<p>It is not without feelings of
anxiety that the editors of the
<span class="smcap">Rural Magazine</span> issue forth
their first number to the public;
for they are aware of the lasting
effect of a first impression, and
that they have now fairly embarked
in an adventure, the success
and the termination of which are
alike uncertain. Diffident however
as they are of their own abilities,
they have full confidence in
the excellence of their plan, and
the kindness and assistance of
their friends. Of the value of this
assistance, the work itself will
testify; of the plan which they
have marked out, it is but fair
that the reader should be informed.</p>

<p>A leading object of the <cite>Rural
Magazine</cite> will be to furnish correct
views of the science of Agriculture,
and the various improvements
which are daily made or
suggested in it. For this purpose
the best and most recent European
works on the subject will be
consulted, and selections made
from the American newspapers
that are devoted or friendly to the
cause. The best information on
the subject will thus be condensed
in a form less unwieldy than a
newspaper, and more popular
than in scientific books. We also
expect original papers from our
agricultural friends, being confident
that there is much in the
farming of our neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
counties, well worthy of being
widely known and imitated.</p>

<p>Yet, as we wish our Magazine
to have an extensive circulation,
and to be interesting not merely
to the farmer, but to the citizen
and the general reader, a considerable
part of every number will
be occupied with topics of general
literature, selections from approved
new publications, particularly
Biography and Travels,
Essays, and information on scientific
subjects; and original miscellaneous
communications. To
original and well written essays,
our pages will always be accessible;
and we particularly solicit
such as will throw light on the
history, antiquities, geography,
curiosities, and productions of our
own country. With the genuine
productions of the Muse we shall
always be glad to adorn our
pages; but we have no desire to
patronize the unfledged attempts
at versifying, the lamentable ditties
with which the public is weekly
besieged, for we hold that in
poetry there is no tolerable medium.</p>

<p>But to an American and a philanthropist,
there are still higher
objects to be gained by the circulation
of such a paper, than the
mere diffusion of agricultural intelligence
or general literature.
He lives under a system of government
which is ideally perfect;
and he sees it distorted by the
vices and the passions of its subjects.
He is the disciple of a
religion which breathes good-will
to mankind; and on whichsoever
side he turns, are to be seen oppression,
the darkness of ignorance,
self-inflicted wretchedness,
and amalgamating corruption.
He sees a large portion of the
human family held in chains by
the very nation that has pronounced
all men to be free and equal.
The condition of that unhappy
race, even when emancipated,
excites his deepest commiseration
and most anxious fears. He sees
the aborigines of our country, a
noble race of men, perishing like
the beasts of the forest before
our approach; and that under
every circumstance of wretchedness
and degeneracy.&mdash;Above all,
the great and fatal delusion of
war, more bloody than the superstitions
of Moloch, still overspreads
the world, and renders
man the destroyer of man.</p>

<p>To all these subjects will the
<cite>Rural Magazine</cite> be watchful and
alive; for the editors believe them
to be subjects of the deepest interest,
and having relation to our
highest duties. He who tills his
field, or pursues his occupation
with diligence and skill, is a deserving
and honourable citizen.
He who, in addition to this, cultivates
his mind, and stores it with
useful and ornamental knowledge,
raises himself in the scale of being,
and adds to his capacities
both for happiness and usefulness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
But when he adds to this industry,
and to these talents and accomplishments,
the benevolence of a
Christian philanthropist, and renders
them subservient to the welfare
of his species, he attains to
the highest dignity of his nature,
and fulfils all the obligations
which devolve on him as a citizen
and a man.</p>

<p>Such are the general outlines
of our plan; and as we feel no
local or political prejudices, they
shall never have place in the discussion
of any subject which may
appear in our columns. Combining
in this manner an agricultural,
a literary, and philanthropic
journal, we look with confidence
to the support of our enlightened
fellow citizens; and
assure them, that no exertions on
our part shall be wanting to fill
up the measure which we have
meted out, and render the <cite>Rural
Magazine</cite> deserving of their patronage.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="center">FOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.</p>


<h2>
<i>To the Editors.</i>
</h2>

<p>You are about embarking in a literary
voyage, calculated, if ably and
prudently conducted, to subserve the
best interests of society. Previously,
however, to your taking a final leave of
terra firma, and before its shores shall
recede from your view, it may be the
part of wisdom to contemplate the
nature and object of your journey, by
the steady lights of experience. The
legitimate end of every enterprise of
the kind, is to enlighten the understanding,
and improve the heart. To
produce a result so important, no exertion
should be omitted, and no
means neglected, to impart a useful
interest to your miscellany. Of the
truth of these preliminary observations,
you are no doubt sufficiently
impressed. To please every taste,
however fastidious, or to gratify in all
respects, the wishes of the million,
would be a task altogether hopeless;
and which a temperament the most
sanguine, would scarcely indulge.
However transcendent may be the
merit of any periodical journal, and
however brilliant its success, should
the editor listen at all the avenues of
public opinion, his ear will notwithstanding
be saluted by many an ungrateful
sound. Some readers will
complain of what they are pleased to
call its dull monotony; while others
will lament the sacrifice of what they
conceive to be matters of importance,
in the pursuit of endless variety.&mdash;Those
who seek for novelty alone,
will sometimes be disappointed; while
others will start objections, because
sufficient respect is not accorded to
the venerated opinions of the olden
time. The gay may sometimes meet
with nothing to excite the smile of
merriment, and the grave and reflecting
may regret to find so little solid
food for the mind. He, however versatile
his talents, who would be a favourite
with them all, must first be
successful in his chase of the ignis
fatuus; or obtain from that fairy region
in which the rainbow reposes its
brilliant arch upon the earth, its treasures
of gold. But if your labours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
should happily tend to give "energy
to virtue, and confidence to truth,"
you will not fail to gratify the wishes
of those whose approbation alone is
worth desiring&mdash;<em>the well principled</em>
of all parties.</p>

<p>It has been said, and repeated times
without number, that to call a rose by
any other name, its odour would be
equally delightful. Although the
fact may be so, the inference that a
name is altogether unimportant, cannot
be supported on just principles of
deduction. Authors, who have reflected
the brightest honours on the
cause of literature and virtue by their
writings, have encountered a difficulty
at the very threshold, in selecting
for them an appropriate name. It
was after some time anxiously devoted
to the subject, by which it would
appear <em>they</em> considered it a matter of
no trifling consequence, that the pious
and elegant <em>Addison</em> adopted that of
a Spectator, and the <em>Sage</em> of Litchfield
that of a Rambler; under which,
with such signal effect, to inculcate
the lessons of moral truth. It has
been observed by one who knew something
of the world, that few circumstances
contribute more essentially to
general success in life, than an engaging
first appearance. So, likewise,
the garb in which it appears, as well
as the name by which it is distinguished,
is more intimately connected
with the extensive popularity of a
work, intended for the general reader,
than at first may be supposed. It is
gratifying therefore to find, that both
these considerations have had with
you their due weight.</p>

<p>The <cite>Rural Magazine</cite> will not only
be a repository for articles of miscellaneous
interest, but peculiarly so for
every thing connected with agriculture,
and a country residence. It is
to rural scenes, and rural innocence,
and rural employments, that man is
principally indebted for many of those
blessings and enjoyments, which impart
a charm to human existence, and
lighten its load of cares and sorrows.
The man, whoever he is, that has long
been confined to a populous city, will
at length with <em>Shenstone</em> sicken with
the unceasing recurrence of artificial
life, and long to breathe the pure atmosphere
of the country. He will
hail with delight the blue bird, earliest
harbinger of spring, and welcome
the primrose, eldest daughter of Flora,
and contemplate with rapture the
vernal season, in which youth, and
beauty, and melody, walk hand in
hand, over verdant lawns, variegated
with flowers, inhaling the zephyrs of
health. Then he will witness summer,
with brown, vigorous, and manly
aspects; and autumn, groaning with
her ripe and mellow fruits; succeeded
by winter, clothed in storms and
glittering with pendent icicles; who
notwithstanding a sternness of mood,
and a manner somewhat uncourteous,
is in the hands of a beneficent Creator
the minister of great good to man.
The fury of the tempest may rage,
and the clattering hail beat against the
windows; the driving snows may deform
the face of day, and nature assume
the appearance of old age and
decay: notwithstanding all this, that
portion of the circling year, of which
we are speaking, will continue to have
its positive pleasures. These will be
closely and intimately united in the
domestic circle, where in charmful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
confederacy they will be found clustering
round the <cite>Evening Fire-side</cite>.
Who does not associate with this delightful
scene his earliest images of
innocent gayety and exquisite enjoyment;
in which garrulous old age
and lisping infancy mingle their voices,
and where carking care never intrudes?
But as the hours are hastening
on with feathery footsteps, they
should likewise minister to the cause
of mental and moral improvement.
The <em>farmer</em> should cultivate a taste
for reading, and store his mind with
useful knowledge; and thus become
qualified to assume the dignified station
to which, in this happy country,
he is fairly entitled. He should remember,
that the plough has been
guided and venerated by the "awful
fathers of mankind;" and that a profession,
to which <em>Cincinnatus</em> and
<em>Washington</em> were zealously and practically
devoted, and for which the
emperor <em>Charles</em> V. exchanged his
sceptre and his crown, must be intrinsically
elevated and respectable.
It is among the yeomanry of our
country that the love of literature,
by whom it is already cherished to a
creditable degree, should be more
widely and universally disseminated.</p>

<p>In order to promote an object so
desirable, may you succeed in assembling
at your <cite>Evening Fire-side</cite> a
cheerful happy group, who, bidding
defiance to the rude clamours of the
storm without, shall entertain topics
of public utility, while cultivating and
improving the domestic virtues; and

<h2><i>Letters of a Citizen to his Friends
in the Country</i>.</h2>



<p class="center"><span class="smcap">No</span> 1.</p>


<p>The establishment of a periodical
work, designed in part for circulation
among my agricultural fellow citizens,
furnishes an opportunity which
I have often desired, to address you.
In contemplating the dignity and utility
which are combined in the occupations
of an American husbandman,
in estimating the extent of influence
which belongs to his character, and
regarding his elevated independence,
I have long since been led to the conclusion,
that the <em>Farmers</em> of the soil
form the basis of the nation's strength,
and ought largely to contribute to its
ornament.</p>

<p>In the occasional communications
which I propose to make to you
through this medium, I shall adopt a
plain, familiar, and candid manner;
and endeavour to point not only at
those errors which certainly exist, but
also attempt to suggest how they can
be most effectually removed.</p>

<p>"What!" methinks I hear some
hardy son of the field exclaim&mdash;"who
is this that promises to improve our
mode of farming?" <em>A Citizen, forsooth.</em>
Now let us at the threshold
understand each other. I do not intend
to meddle much, if at all, with
your system of agriculture, though I
conceive it quite possible for a man
who has been born and educated in a
<em>city</em>, to furnish important hints for the
improvement of rural affairs. My
purpose is to interest your attention
with subjects which may tend to enlarge
and elevate your <em>minds</em>. It is a
lamentable fact, that too little regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
is paid to <em>intellectual cultivation</em>,
among those who till the earth.</p>

<p>A well managed farm, supplied
with substantial buildings, and under
good fence, is creditable to its possessor,
and forms a part of the public
wealth. Every individual who thus
improves his land, not only enriches
himself, but should be considered as
a benefactor of the commonwealth.
Here, unhappily, the energies of the
farmer are limited. This is a radical
error. With the pecuniary means
which his industry has accumulated,
he should increase his own intelligence,
and confer upon his children
the benefits of <em>substantial education</em>.
I do not admit as truth, what is frequently
asserted, that the best examples
of morality and virtue are to be
met with in the country; for whereever
the improvement of the mind is
neglected, those ennobling qualities
will be rarely found. It is idle to
suppose that our intellectual capacities
will yield fruits which dignify and
adorn our nature, if they be solely
devoted to increase our worldly possessions.
The plough turns up from
the soil no nourishment for the mind,
neither do the scythe and sickle prostrate
the vices of the heart.</p>

<p>Abstractedly, therefore, a man may
be as destitute of good principles who
lives amidst rural scenes, as he whose
pursuits confine him to the busy
haunts and contagious influences of
the multitude.</p>

<p>But I am beginning to lecture before
I have an audience. I took up
the pen merely to introduce my proposals
to your notice. You have a
specimen of my way of thinking. If
you like it, so much the better; if
not, I cannot promise to serve a more
palatable dish&mdash;but am always your
friend,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[The subject of the Missouri state bill,
involves, in our opinion, an agricultural
question, important to the last degree to
the farmers of America:&mdash;Whether that
great country west of the Mississippi, compared
with which all the United States are
small, shall, in future ages, be dotted over
with pleasant villages and comfortable farm
houses, and cultivated by the industrious
owners of the soil, each vieing with his
neighbour in beautifying the face of nature:
or be blotted and defaced by innumerable
wretched habitations of miserable slaves,
with here and there, on distant eminences,
the <em>lone</em> mansions of their masters. Whether
that great country, now left rich by
nature, shall be converted into barren
wastes by continued exhausting crops of
tobacco and Indian corn, without one shovel-ful
of manure to invigorate the expiring
soil, as has been the case in some of the
fine districts of Virginia and Maryland; or
whether it shall be covered with luxuriant
fields of wheat, rich meadows and innumerable
herds.&mdash;Viewing this great national
question, so intimately connected with our
favourite subject, we feel the more interest
by giving an insertion to the following

<h2><i>Extension of Slavery.</i></h2>

<p>It is the great and distinguishing
feature of our free government, that
it is built upon the eternal principles
of justice and rectitude. The passions
and the interests of its subjects or administrators
may pervert its original
design, and wield the power it confers
to the purposes of oppression or
licentiousness. So long, however, as
we have access to the charter of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
constitution, the great original fountain
of our laws, we may renew or
purify those streams which have become
choked up or polluted. It forms
a perpetual and unerring standard by
which to judge of principles and policy;
and whatever measures are found
wanting in its scale, may safely be pronounced
to be unwise and unsound.
The flux and change of opinions and
interests, the perpetual encroachments
of wealth and power, the decay
of old prejudices and jealousies, and
the rise of new ones, wear away continually
the old landmarks, and imperceptibly
give to our institutions a new
aspect and new bearings. While we
admit this flexibility to be in a certain
measure necessary for the conservation
of peace and union, we must
steadily insist upon its being limited
by the great leading features of
the constitution, and that reference
should constantly be had to first principles,
as to a fountain of life and
strength.</p>

<p>Never, surely, has there been a
question agitated, in which those principles
were so deeply at issue, as in
the one which is now before the American
people. I need scarcely say,
that I allude to the Missouri state
bill, and to the introduction of slaves
beyond the Mississippi. This subject
has been ably and repeatedly discussed.
A universal expression of sentiment
has gone forth from the people
of the northern and middle states, and
it has awakened powers of eloquence
and argument that have seldom been
surpassed. That first burst of emotion
has subsided; and now that the
question is upon the point of being
settled, it may not be altogether useless
to recall the attention of the public
to the subject.</p>

<p>That slavery is a crime against God
and nature, and that its existence in
our free country is a most dangerous
and lamentable evil, cannot be doubted.
Our only apology as a nation for
its existence, is, that we found it among
us, and that an overruling necessity
obliged us to leave its extirpation to
the hand of time and experience.</p>

<p>The august founders of our republic
have not once named it in the constitution,
as if they were unwilling that
so foul a name should stain the purity
of our escutcheon, as if it were a
crime against humanity too execrable
to be uttered. They looked forward
to a period when it should cease and
be forgotten, and made ample provision
for its future annihilation. Their
solemn declaration to the world, "We
hold these truths to be self-evident,
that all men are created equal; that
they are endowed by their Creator
with certain <em>unalienable</em> rights, and
that among these are life, <em>liberty</em>,
and the pursuit of happiness," had
otherwise been the worst of mockeries.</p>

<p>The words of the constitution,
"The migration or importation of
such persons as any of the states <em>now
existing</em> shall think proper to admit,
shall not be prohibited by the Congress,
prior to the year 1808; but a
tax may be imposed on such person
not exceeding ten dollars for each
person,"&mdash;clearly show, beyond the
possibility of a cavil, that the right
to legislate concerning slaves is vested
in the general government, and
that the convention was fearful that
the attempt to exercise it might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
made, before the southern states were
prepared for any laws upon the subject.
The Congress has, in fact, uniformly
exercised this right in all its
laws for the government of the new
states and territories. It prohibited
the importation of slaves and their
migration into the northwestern territory.
The states which ceded the
territory south of the Ohio, and east
of the Mississippi, were fully aware
of this power of Congress; and they
ceded it with certain stipulations in
favour of the slave holder. Yet even
over the states which were formed in
this region, has Congress exercised its
power, and secured to the slave the
right of trial by jury and of the habeas
corpus. All these laws were passed
without exciting any suspicion that
Congress was transcending its powers
in thus clogging the constitutions of
the new states. They were regarded
as decent and becoming in a government
founded in justice and freedom,
"as extending the fundamental principles
of civil and religious liberty."
That northwestern territory offered
no inducement to the slave holder, or
to a slave agriculture. Now, however,
the case is altered. A province
adapted to the cultivation of cotton
and tobacco, and in obtaining which
the government made no stipulations
in favour of slavery, claims to be elevated
to the rank of a state. It is a
desirable situation for the planters,
and holds out from its situation and
fertility a golden prospect. They
claim accordingly to be admitted
there, with their slaves; and a clamour
is raised because the people of
the United States are unwilling further
to extend slavery&mdash;to sacrifice
the principles of our republic upon
the altar of avarice.</p>

<p>The pretence&mdash;it scarcely deserves
the name of argument&mdash;is, that such
restriction would be <em>unconstitutional</em>,
<em>oppressive</em>, and <em>inexpedient</em>.</p>

<p>It is <span class="smcap">UNCONSTITUTIONAL</span>!&mdash;The refutation
is a part of our history, and
is written in the pages of our statute
book. It is <span class="smcap">OPPRESSIVE</span>! It would
exclude the southern states from sharing
in the benefits of these new settlements.
Are not the lands open to all,
and disposed of at public sale? They
can only be made valuable, it is true,
by incessant labour, under severe privations.
But this the hardy yeomanry
of the eastern and middle states are
willing to endure for the sake of independence
and an establishment for
their families. We see them accordingly
in the van of our empire, subduing
the forest and filling the wilderness
with the busy sounds of industry
and contentment. Are the slave
holders of the south a privileged order,
that these labours would demean
them? Are they oppressed by being
placed on an equality with their brethren
of the north, who leave behind
them all the artificial distinctions and
luxurious indulgences of society?
Are not their arms and limbs as capable
of labour, and their bodies of fatigue?
Where then is the inequality
and the oppression? A citizen of a
slave holding state, at home, and under
his state laws, may be a petty monarch;
and he is apt to fancy that he
derives the power from an inherent
birth-right. But out of his state, and
from under its laws, he is an individual
unit, a mere citizen of the United
States; and can claim no privilege<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
which is not granted to every American,
or which is opposed to the spirit
and intent of the constitution. That
constitution pays no respect to persons.
It does not recognise the existence
of slavery; and the petition to
admit it in the new states, is a glaring
mockery of its character.</p>

<p>It has been contended, that after
the state was organized, the inhabitants
might assemble in convention,
and alter the constitution in this respect.
Such an assertion betrays the
grossest ignorance of the true principles
of the Union. Our government
is emphatically a <em>compact</em>, originally
between the people; and since then,
between Congress as their representative,
and the new members. It is
binding on both sides, and the terms
of admission are, that Congress approves
of the constitution which the
state has formed. Its power of rejection,
it is true, is limited to certain
points. But upon those points that
power is absolute; and amongst them,
without a shadow of doubt, is <em>slavery.</em>
The state which, having accepted of
a limitation to its power in this respect,
should presume to alter it,
would set that power at defiance.</p>

<p>But the restriction is <span class="smcap">INEXPEDIENT</span>!
And what is the amount of inexpediency?
Some thousands of dollars less
to the public revenue&mdash;some hundreds
of thousands less in the sale of
public lands! Forbid it, Justice! forbid
it, the Genius of the Constitution!
that we should barter our free inheritance
for a mess of pottage; that the
countrymen of Washington should
coolly calculate the profits of a desertion
of principle. But not only is the
restriction not inexpedient, it is called
for by the clearest dictates of sound
policy. We are now entering upon a
region of almost boundless extent and
fertility, destined at some future day
to be the abode of millions of human
beings. Upon the decision of the
present question, in all probability,
will it depend, whether that population
will be a free and industrious
race, or whether the great majority
will be bound in the chains of slavery,
stinting the growth and paralyzing
the energies of the community.</p>

<p>If it be fairly decided that slavery shall
not exist to the west of the Mississippi,
we shall soon see the rich
vallies of that territory occupied by
industrious farmers, proving what is
no doubt the fact, that freemen can
cultivate the staple commodities of
that country more advantageously
than slaves. Let us for a moment
contrast the opposite pictures which
are here presented.</p>

<p>The privileged order of the southern
states have, it is true, every temporal
blessing they can desire, save
that of security. But their hordes of
slaves&mdash;a million of labourers, chained
down to cheerless and incessant
toil, shrouded in utter intellectual
darkness, cut off from all that ennobles
and adorns existence, stationary
amidst the general march of improvement,
and sold and driven about like
herds of cattle;&mdash;is there not in this
picture, retouch it and soften it as you
may, subject for bitter regret? and is
there nothing to cheer the heart of the
patriot in the reverse? A country
studded with villages and farms; a
smiling and contented population; intelligent,
virtuous, and industrious,
and the strength and the pride of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
nation, and becoming in its turn the
hive for fresh swarms of emigrants.
This is no exaggerated or romantic
representation. These opposite conditions
exist in our country; and Congress
have now to decide which of
them shall give its features to the
western valley of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>But it is from motives of humanity
and security, say some, that we plead
the extension of slavery. The evil
will thus be diluted and lessened.
Admirable politicians! profound economists!
A poisonous plant has overgrown
one of your fields, and you seek
to extirpate it by spreading the seeds
throughout your possessions! A concealed
fire is smouldering in your
house, and you would prevent its conflagration
by scattering the embers
upon your neighbours' dwellings!</p>

<p>It is not thus that slavery is to be
mitigated or done away. Confine slavery
within its present limits, and we
may then hope to see it extinguished.
We are young, and may outgrow it.
There is a great body of active and
enlightened philanthropy in the southern
states; and it may yet devise
means for its extinction. Build around
it a circumvallation of freemen, and
you render impotent its fearful threatenings.
But give to it that principle
of indefinite increase which our white
population derives from the inexhaustible
extent of our country, and you
spread it over the face of the Union;
you clothe it a hundred fold with terrors;
you render it coeval with our
empire.</p>

<p>But not only this. The slave trade
from Africa to the United States will
never be abolished, if we allow of slavery
to the west of the Mississippi.
So great will be the value of slaves
along the rich bottoms of that territory,
that no laws, however severe,
can put a stop to their importation.
That accursed traffic is even now carried
on with impunity, and to an incredible
extent. Fifteen thousand victims
have been worse than immolated
at its shrine within a single year. With
greater temptations to engage in it,
in more remote situations, and along
an unguarded frontier, no human
power can altogether check it.</p>

<p>Nor will it be merely a foreign
slave trade that this extension will
encourage. An internal traffic will
take place. The poorer and more
healthy states will become the breeders
for the new and unhealthy districts;
and it will happen as it has
ever done, that the pursuit of a trade,
wicked and cruel in itself, will entail
the commission of crimes, the violation
of every moral law, <em>the begetting
of offspring for the purposes of an
unholy traffic</em>. A deadly taint will
spread over the morals and character
of our country, which not all our professions
of liberty can purify; and if
there be any prophecy in history, the
rights of these long degraded beings
will one day be vindicated with awful
retribution.</p>

<p>I have treated this subject with
warmth; with more warmth, perhaps,
than has served my cause. But I
cannot think without indignation of
the attempt which is now making to
extend the empire of slavery&mdash;a despotism
in the bosom of a republic;
and which I believe to be pregnant
with the most disastrous consequences.
It is necessary that the public
mind should be kept awake on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
subject; and I cannot refrain from
lifting up my feeble voice on the occasion.</p>

<p>One word more, and I have done.
The division in Congress upon this
subject, has been truly called a geographical
division. The members
from the south, with scarcely an exception,
voted for the introduction of
slaves. Yet from the same quarter
do we hear of splendid schemes for
colonization and emancipation, for
eradicating slavery, and pouring the
light of civilization and religion upon
ravaged and benighted Africa. Many
of the most conspicuous actors in
this great scheme of benevolence, are
the men who have exerted all their
talents upon the floor of Congress to
increase the evils over which in another
place they mourn; to sink us
still deeper in the dangers into which
they have confessed we are plunged.</p>

<p>What are we to think, Gentlemen,
of the purity of your motives, or the
sincerity of your professions? Is it
that your fears, and not your benevolence,
impel you; that you wish to
rid yourselves of the free blacks, and
rivet and extend your dominion over
the slaves? If these imputations are
false, show yourselves at least to be
consistent. Do not by your own act
extend the evils you so eloquently regret.
Give us that proof of the sincerity
of your benevolence (the only
one we can believe) that it is stronger
than your sense of private interest.
Prove to us that you are honestly bent
upon exterminating slavery, and there
are thousands who now stand aloof,
that will join you with all their strength
in any scheme that can effect it; thousands,
whose daily prayer is, that the
mercy of an all-just Providence may
avert from our country the calamities
of a servile war and a divided empire.</p>

<p>We ask of you no extravagant or
impracticable scheme of emancipation;
We do not wish to see your
Helots invested suddenly with privileges
which they would only abuse;
nor do we look <em>for your relief and
theirs</em>, to any other means than those
which time and cautious experience
may suggest. But we beseech you,
as you are sincere in your plans of
colonization, as you value the fair
fame of our common country, as you
regard the security and prosperity of
all future generations&mdash;to stay the
plague of slavery from spreading, and
to give to the inhabitants of the Missouri
a charter which shall not disgrace
the great principles of our revolution,
nor <em>allow man to be the tyrant
of his fellow man</em>.</p>

<p class="center">No. I.</p>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>, <i>Sept</i>. 8, 1819.<br />
</p>

<p>My dear G.&mdash;You will perhaps be
surprised at my dating this letter from
this place, but I shall shortly explain
to you the reason. We arrived in perfect
safety at Baltimore on the 6th
inst., after a very pleasant passage; not
unusually short, but rendered exceedingly
<em>comfortable</em> (that dear English
word, although they have here naturalised
it, as they do almost everything
that comes from us,) by the kind, social,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and attentive manners of Capt. &mdash;&mdash;.
To give you a detail of all the circumstances
of our voyage would
be unnecessary. I do not wish to
nauseate you with the revolting particulars
of a landsman's initiation to
the ocean. We had not that humiliation
to undergo which would have
been our lot if the equinoctial had unfortunately
crossed our path; but we
had enough to inspire us with a perfect
sense of our own inferiority to,
and dependence on that Power that
can rule the winds and the waves.
However, our dear Mrs. and Miss
&mdash;&mdash; were so much affected by the
motion of the ship, and other associations,
that we enjoyed very little of
their company. The first appearance
of land, even that land, which since
my recollection has been supposed to
be inhabited by spirits, hostile in late,
although similar in early habits to
ourselves, was greeted with most sincere
satisfaction. That land was inhabited
by Christians, by men like
ourselves, derived from the same origin,
boasting of equal laws adopted
from our code in general principles,
and operating like our own upon
freemen. We were landed in consequence
of an unfavourable wind, at
Norfolk; where, although we staid
but a few minutes, I was sorrowfully
convinced that all the inhabitants of
the land I was visiting were not freemen.</p>

<p>A public sale of blacks was about
to take place, and my first introduction
to the country I had so joyfully
pictured, was associated with feelings
to which I had till then been a
stranger. Poor wretches, thought I,
as they passed badly clothed and manacled
through the streets, you give
an alien a strange idea of the consistency
of your rulers, and a lamentable
evidence of the truth of the political
axiom, that those who feel power, forget
right. As I shall probably visit
Norfolk in common with the other
maritime towns of Virginia, before I
return, sufficient interest has been excited
in my mind to enable me to assure
you, that I shall give you further
details of the situation of that unfortunate
class of human beings.</p>

<p>From Norfolk our voyage to Baltimore
surpassed all my former ideas
of rapidity. We passed up to Baltimore
in so short a space of time, and
in <em>such</em> a steam-boat, that I dread your
incredulity were I to give you particulars.
Let it suffice that <em>but a few
hours</em> brought us to Baltimore, reputed
to be in commercial importance
the fourth city in the Union. You
know it was my first object to visit the
respectable gentlemen in this place to
to whom I have letters, and most of
whom have at one time or another
done business with our house. But
on the instant of my arrival I was utterly
confounded by the intelligence
that the yellow fever, that scourge of
America, and so justly dreaded by all
Europeans, but more particularly by
the inhabitants of northern climates,
had made its appearance at a place
called Fell's Point, either in the vicinity
of the city, or forming one of
the suburbs; I was in too much consternation
to learn which. Indeed I
was so much annoyed by the continual
reports of the <em>yellow fever</em> at <em>the Point</em>,
and what they called the <em>bank fever</em>
in the city, that I could hardly tell
where I was, or what I was to do.&mdash;Luckily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
a very good looking gentleman,
seeing my perplexity, and imagining&mdash;for
I cannot tell how else he
happened to fix upon me&mdash;that I was
an Englishman, told me that I could
not get out of the city of Baltimore
too soon, because it had had the curse
of Cain upon it ever since the celebrated
mob business (that we heard
our Maryland friend R. speak about)
some years ago, that it had the plague
at the Point, and the yellow or white
fever, he did not care which, at the
other end of the town. This would
have been news almost enough to
frighten our lamented friend General
R. (if he ever could have known fear;)
and instead of visiting the spot where
he terminated his brief career in this
world, which I intended to have done
on the moment of my landing, as performing
the last pious act of duty to his
memory that affection demanded, I
determined to fly from this new enemy
with almost as much precipitation as
the Yankees (by <em>our</em> official accounts)
fled from our departed hero in his
various incursions in the states, adjoining
the waters of the Chesapeake.
I ordered a post chaise <em>instanter</em>.
The servant replied, "it went before
day, sir." Is it possible, said I, that
at a house frequented as this is, (Mr.
G's.) there is but one post chaise. Get
me one at any rate, I returned in a
pretty quick tone, and have my baggage
put to it immediately. "Why,
master," rejoined George, (I thought
the better of him for his name, and
perhaps, novice as I am, because he
was black) "there is no other post
chaise till to-morrow; but the steam-boat
will go at five o'clock, master,
if that will suit you." It wanted but
a few minutes of that hour. I leaped
into a hackney coach, (which by the
way I was surprised to see in such a
new country, unless it had been moved
by steam) and ere the hour had struck,
was safe on board a very commodious
vessel, furnished with every thing to
make a night passage pleasant.</p>

<p>It is upwards of one hundred miles
from Baltimore to Philadelphia, by
land, even by their lately improved
roads; yet, with no interruption except
being transported some sixteen
or twenty miles over good roads, in
very bad stage coaches, we enjoyed
ourselves in our births till I was
awakened before nine the next morning,
by the steward, who informed me
we were at the wharf, in the place of
our destination.</p>

<p>I forthwith repaired, as my previous
instructions directed, to the large
and commodious hotel of Mr. R.;
where I met with several of my old
friends, and some quondam fellow-voyagers,
who, influenced by business,
or perhaps the same instinctive
dread of yellow fever with myself,

my dear W., I still remain.
In the twenty-four hours that have

the monotony of a sea voyage, and the

from the ocean to <i>terra firma</i>, some
few days must be allotted to repose.</p>

<p class="center">On the Rise and Progress of Agriculture.</p>


<p>The origin of this art is lost among
the fables of antiquity, and we have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
regret, that in the present state of
knowledge, we are even ignorant of
the <em>time</em>, when the plough was invented,
and of the <em>name</em> and <em>condition</em>
of the inventor. When therefore we
speak of the beginning of the art, we
but allude to certain appearances
which indicate its existence, and the
employment given by it to the minds,
as well as to the hands, of mankind.
Such were the artificial canals and
lakes of Egypt. Menaced at one time
by a redundancy of water, and at another
by its scarcity or want, the genius
of that extraordinary people could not
but employ itself, promptly and strenuously,
in remedying these evils, and
eventually, in converting them into
benefits; and hence it was, that when
other parts of the world exhibited
little more of agricultural knowledge
than appertains to the state of nature,
imagined by philosophers, the Egyptians
thoroughly understood and skilfully
practised <em>irrigation</em>, that most
scientific and profitable branch of the
art.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Like their own Nile, their population
had its overflow, which colonized
Carthage and Greece, and carried
with it the talent and intelligence
of the mother country. The former
of these states, though essentially commercial,
had its <em>plantations</em>, and so
highly prized were the agricultural
works of Mago, that when Carthage
was captured, they alone, of the many
books found in it, were retained and
translated by the Romans. A similar
inference may be drawn from the history
of Greece; for assuredly that art
could not have been either unknown
or neglected, which so long employed
the pen and the tongue of the great
Xenophon.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It must however be admitted,
that of the ancient nations, it
is only among the Romans, that we
find real and multiplied evidences of
the progress of the art; <em>facts</em>, substituted
for <em>conjectures</em> and <em>inferences</em>.
Cato, Varro, Columella, Virgil and
Pliny, wrote on the subject, and it is
from their works we derive the following
brief exposition of Roman husbandry.</p>

<p>The plough, the great instrument
of agricultural labour, was well known
and generally used among them; it
was drawn exclusively by horned cattle.
Of fossile <em>manures</em>, we know that
they used <em>lime</em>, and probably <em>marle</em>,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
and that those of animal and vegetable
basis, were carefully collected.
Attention to this subject, even made
part of the national religion; the
dunghill had its god, and Stercutus,
his temple and worshippers. Their
corn crops were abundant; besides
<em>barley</em> and <em>far</em>,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> they had three species
of <em>wheat</em>; the <em>robus</em> or red&mdash;the
<em>siligo</em> or white&mdash;and the <em>triticum trimestre</em>,
or summer wheat; they had
besides millet, panis, zea (Indian
corn) and rye, all of which producing
a flour convertible into bread, were
known by the common name of <em>frumentum</em>.
Leguminous crops were
frequent; the lupin in particular was
raised in abundance, and besides being
employed as a manure,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> entered
extensively into the subsistence of
men, cattle and poultry. The cultivation
of garden vegetables was well
understood and employed many hands;
and meadows, natural and artificial,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
were brought to great perfection.
Lucern and fenugrec were the basis
of the latter, and peas, rye and a mixture
of barley, beans and peas, called
<em>farrago</em>, were occasionally used in
the stables as green food. Their
flocks were abundant, and formed
their first representatives of wealth,
as is sufficiently indicated by their
word <em>pecunia</em>. Vines and olives, and
their products (wine and oil) had a
full share of attention and use. The
rearing of poultry made an important
part of domestic economy, nor were
apiaries and fish ponds forgotten or
neglected.</p>

<p>If we pause for a moment, to glance
at the civil institutions of this wonderful
people, we discover how soon
and how deeply it entered into their
policy, not merely to promote, but to
dignify agriculture and its professors.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
When Cicero said, that "nothing in
this world was better, more useful,
more agreeable, more worthy of a
free man, than agriculture;"<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> he
pronounced, not merely his own opinion,
but the public judgment of his
age and nation. Were troops to be
raised for the defence of the republic?
The <i>tribus rusticus</i> was the privileged
nursery of the legions!<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Did
exigencies of state require a general
or dictator? he was taken from the
<em>plough</em>! Were his services rewarded?
this was done not with ribbands
or gold, but by a donation of <em>land</em>.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>With such support from public
opinion, it was not to be supposed
that the laws would be either adverse
or indifferent to this branch of industry.
We accordingly find the utmost
security given to the labours of the
husbandman;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> no legislative interposition
between the seller and buyer,
neither forced sales&mdash;nor limitation
of prices&mdash;and a sacredness of boundaries
never disturbed;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> fairs and
markets multiplied and protected
against invasion or interruption,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and
highways leading to these every where
established, and of a character to call
forth benedictions and admiration.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Nor were these regulations confined
to the proper territory of Rome.
What of her own policy was good,
she communicated to her neighbours;
what of theirs was better, she adopted
and practised herself. Her arts and
arms were therefore constant companions.
Wherever her legions marched,
her knowledge, practices, and implements
followed; and it is to these
we are to look for the foundation of
modern agriculture in Italy, France,
Spain, &amp;c.</p>

<h2><i>The Moral Plough Boy</i>.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">"In the morning sow thy seed, and in the
evening withhold not thine hand."</p></blockquote>


<p>The words of our motto were probably
addressed by an Eastern monarch
to those of his subjects, who
followed husbandry, and to whom the
importance of early rising was the
greater, as the climate was excessively
warm, and the stoutest labourer
found the noon-tide heat too powerful
for the energies of his frame to
encounter.&mdash;This is the case in most
of the oriental climes, where the
morning and the evening are improved
by the cultivator of the soil, as well
as the man of business of every class,
cast or profession.&mdash;The middle or
hottest part of the day is, in those
countries, given to ease and relaxation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and the charms of conversation,
and the sweets of refreshment, are
then the substitutes for toil and care.</p>

<p>But the time thus spent is not lost,
because they attend strictly to the advice
of the sacred moralist, and make
it up by the fidelity of their morning
and evening labours in the field, the
workship or the counting-room. Besides
the earth is there more prolific
than in colder climes, like ours, and
to less labour yields a greater supply,
a more abundant harvest.</p>

<p>But abundantly as the earth yields
her products, beneath an oriental sky,
still it was there that man was first
taught by his Maker, that she would
not yield them without the sweat of
the human brow. Implicit obedience
was the first law given to our progenitors
in Eden, as the condition of enjoying
life without labour, of being
surrounded by the perpetual verdure
of spring, and regaled by the never-dying
fragrance of its odours: But this
fair condition violated, and they were
doomed to know, that fruitful as the
earth had come from the hands of its
Creator, they should cultivate it with
toil, and care, and anxiety, before it
should yield them the means of enjoyment
and subsistence. But for one
fatal mistake, they would never have
been called upon to sow their seed in
the morning, and at evening to watch
over it with a careful hand.</p>

<p>We have seen then, that the first
Plough Boys were obliged to work
early and late; and their successors
in the same climes, are still subjected
to the same diurnal labour.</p>

<p>But the American Plough Boy enjoys
a milder clime, and may perhaps
think himself less obliged to rise with
the dawn of day, or pursue his labours
with the declining sun. He may perhaps
flatter himself that the morning
may be spent at a neighbouring bar-room,
and the evening at a shooting-match
or a horse-race, and the day
still afford time enough for all the labour
that he may have to perform.
But this is, indeed, an error the most
fatal to his present, as well as future
happiness. The mid-day beams of
the sun are not so fierce on the hills
or vales of America, as on the plains
of Asia, where our first parents were
doomed to earn their bread by the
sweat of their brow. But they are still
fierce enough to make the <span class="smcap">Plough
Boy</span> feel their enervating effects, and
to impress upon his physical as well
as mental frame the necessity and importance
of <em>sowing his seed in the
morning</em>, and of extending to it the
<em>vigilance of his hand in the evening</em>.</p>

<p>If our American Plough Boys
would, one and all, adopt with energy
and perseverance this injunction of
oriental wisdom, how different would
be the face of our country, in many
places, from what it now is! How
many orchards would be planted;
how many fruit trees, of every kind,
would be seen growing in beauty and
luxuriance, where now the eye of the
traveller, or sojourner, is obliged to
rest upon nought but wilds and weeds?
How many fields would be ploughed
and sown, and cultivated with success,
which now lie waste, and barren as the
deserts of Arabia. How many cattle,
and domestic animals of every description,
fit for the use of man, would be
seen thriving and healthy, awaiting a
profitable market, where now there
are none, or those whose sickly and
squalid appearance, bespeaks the indolence
and neglect of their owners!
How many substantial rail fences
would be erected, where there is now
scarcely a brush bulwark against the
encroachments of man or beast? How
many neat stone walls would take the
place of rail fences, and remain as
lasting monuments of the virtue of
their owners&mdash;for <em>industry</em> and <em>virtue</em>
are synonimous in agricultural life!
How many ditches would be seen running
through our swamps, and yielding
or restoring to wholesome vegetation,
those nurseries of wild, unprofitable,
and poisonous plants; whose
dark, damp shades are not only lost
to agriculture; but send forth daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
their pestilential vapours, spreading
disease and death among the Plough
Boys!</p>

<p>It is not the industrious Plough
Boy who will feel the application of
these remarks. He will take care that
his fields and his fences, his flourishing
fruit-trees, his overflowing cribs
and barns, and his fat cattle, plump
and smooth as a turtle-fed alderman,
shall prove to the world that he never
fails to attend to the admonition of our
motto.</p>

<p>But it is to the slothful that this
short essay is addressed. Pluck up
the weeds, and the useful plants will
take care of themselves. Reform the
indolent, and the industrious will find
a new spur to exertion. Ye careless
and slothful Plough Boys, then, be
advised by a friend. Cast off the sin
of idleness, which so easily besets you,
and imitate your industrious neighbours.
Resolve for the future, <em>in the
morning to sow your seed, and in the
evening to withhold not your hand</em>;
and you will soon find, that the blessings
of Heaven await those who deserve
them; and that health, prosperity,
and a quiet conscience, are the
never-failing rewards of virtuous industry.

<p class="hanging"><i>On a Rotation of Crops, and the
most profitable mode of collecting,
preserving, and applying
Manures</i>.</p>

<p class="center">(Communicated to the Albany County Agricultural
Society.)</p>


<p>Some soils are peculiarly adapted
for the growth of particular plants,
and in such case many successive
yearly growths of them may be raised,
without manure, and without material
diminution of product. We
have known an instance of 14 good
crops of wheat raised successively on
the same ground; another of 18 crops
of oats; others of at least 10 of barley,
and nearly of 20 rye: But these
were peculiar soils; and although this
sameness of culture was found successful,
no inference is therefore to
be drawn that it was the most profitable,
or that such soils would not
eventually tire of their favourite
crops, and then be found exhausted
and unfit for others. Generally speaking,
we conceive that one of the most
important points in husbandry is a
judicious rotation of such crops as
are most profitable for culture, and at
the same time best adapted for the
particular soils which are to be cultivated.
Lands seem naturally to require
a change of growths. Where
the oak has disappeared, after it had
lifted its head to the springs of ages,
another oak will not naturally rise,
but some other tree. Instances have
been known of lands covered solely
with trees of deciduous growth, where
the knots of the pitch pine were still
to be found; a proof that pine was
once a tenant of the soil. In the
southern states, where lands have
been exhausted with injudicious cropping,
and then thrown out to common,
they soon become covered with
growths of trees different from those
they originally bore. Some plants
are so unfit for long continuance in
any particular place that they are endowed
with migratory powers, either
by their winged seeds, which are wafted
abroad by the winds; by their
roots, by which they change their
places of growth beneath the surface;
or by their vines, by which they travel
above ground, and thus locate
themselves in different situations. Of
the first description are the varieties
of the thistle, the milk-weed, and the
fire-weed; of the second, the potato
and some other bulbous rooted plants;
of the third, the straw-berry, the
black-berry, the different species of
the gourd tribe. The stalks of erect
plants fall when they ripen, and thus
the seed reaches the ground at a distance
from the roots which produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
them. There seems, indeed, to be
generally a disposition in the earth
to require changes in the plants it
nourishes, in order that it may impart
the food that is best adapted for
each; and Providence, in his infinite
wisdom, has endowed these while
growing in a state of nature, with such
properties as are best calculated to
effect the changes. Let the cultivator,
therefore, study nature, and follow
her dictates, if he wishes either
success or applause in his employment.</p>

<p>In regard to changes of crops, a
general rule has been recommended
of alternate growths of leguminous
and culmiferous kinds, and of green
crops and grain crops; but perhaps
it would be quite as philosophical to
insist upon alternate growths of fibrous,
and tap-rooted plants; the former
deriving their food from the surface
of the earth, the latter from greater
depths. But the value of crops, and
the expense of raising each, should be
duly estimated in making selections
for rotations. Let us say, for instance,
that the average crops of wheat, barley,
and Indian corn, at their greatest
extent, may average 50 dollars in value
to the acre, after the grain is ready
for market; crops of rye, oats and
peas, not more than two thirds of this
amount; buck-wheat, considerably
less. From lands suitable for ruta
baga, or mangel wurzel, it would
seem that from five to six hundred
bushels to the acre may be expected
with good culture; which at 18 cents
per bushel, a price certainly not beyond
the proportionate value we have
just given to the grain crops, will average
about a hundred dollars to the
value of an acre. The entire expense
of either of these crops of roots, when
ready for use, is not essentially greater
than the expense incurred in producing
grain crops; of course, it must
be evident that these afford from 30
to 50 dollars an acre less of clear profit
than a crop of either of the roots
first mentioned. With a proper application
of the requisite quantity of
manure to ruta baga, it may be successfully
grown on almost any dry
soil, when well and deeply mellowed,
from the sandy to the deep rich
loams. Soils of the latter description
are best adapted for mangle
wurzel. Either of these roots, when
steam boiled, and especially with the
addition of some meal, will answer
all the purposes for which grain is
used for feeding cattle of all sorts,
from the horse down to the hog.
Even stage horses, which, from the
severity of their labour, require the
most nourishing food, have been kept
in England on hay and steam-boiled
ruta baga. Mr. Cobbett says, "a
hog of a good sort may be sufficiently
fatted with this root when steam-boiled."
Allowing, what we believe
can hardly be admitted, that a bushel
of oats contains as much nutriment as
three of this root, still it is evident
that the usual product of one acre of
it will go as far in keeping horses as
four of oats. Neither of these root
crops require any considerable expenditure
in seed, and on this account,
if on no other, they are preferable
to crops of the potato and of
the Jerusalem artichoke, which in
the article of seed are perhaps the
most expensive of any whatever. We
however consider crops even of these
roots more profitable than those of
grain, and particularly the potato,
when judiciously cultivated in climates
most suitable for its growth.
For the various uses of this root for
culinary purposes it stands indeed
without a rival. In point of profit we
would also give to the carrot, the
parsnip, and the onion, a preference
to crops of grain; but the soils well
adapted for them is more limited,
and their culture is more expensive;
and although they should form a part
of the products of the farm we cannot
recommend them as being in all instances
proper for a judicious rotation
of crops. The common turnip, and
the cabbage, are also entitled to attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
The pumpkin is as nutritious
as the same weight of any root or
vegetable whatever, and its culture
is cheap; but whether its product, in
weight, can be made to compete with
that of roots, is a matter of which we
are not informed. If 15 tons to the
acre could be usually obtained of this
species of gourd, we should be induced
to pronounce the crop, in point
of profit and use, unrivalled as a preparative
for a crop of winter grain.
The crop would be found among those
which are least expensive in seed, in
culture and in gathering; none would
occasion less exhaustion of soil, nor
require less for manure, as a little
gypsum to the hills, or drills, will
be found to have a powerful effect
on its growth, but of its more complete
cultivation we shall presently
speak.</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania, and farther to the
south, a successful mode of culture
has been put in practice of growing
Indian corn and potatoes in alternate
rows or drills, and in this way about
a sixth more of product in the aggregate,
is obtained from the ground,
than if these two sorts of crops were
cultivated separately. Such is found
to be the fact, and the reason for it
seems to be that each crop has, in this
way, more space given for the extension
of its roots in search of its favourite
food, and each has the like room
above ground for deriving from the
air the nutriment that is most suitable.
Corn, in particular, it is well
known, is liable to much injury, if
planted too closely. There is, indeed,
a variety of cases where this
mingling of growths is found very
advantageous, and whenever we shall
venture to recommend the practice,
it will be founded on a conviction of
its utility. There are also some instances,
even in this northern latitude,
in which two crops may be had in a
season from the same ground, and
any case where it may be advisable
shall be duly noted.</p>

<p>It should farther be observed that
in suggesting what may be deemed
the most suitable changes of crops,
no reference will be had to the actual
state of farming among us, but merely
what the state of farming ought to
be; and in pursuance of this course,
we shall, in a great measure, discard
the idea, too long prevalent in this
country, that we should make the
most of our labour, not the most of
our land; we shall, on the contrary,
insist that, generally speaking, making
the most of our lands, under a
proper course of husbandry, is the
right way to realize the most from
our labour. We shall therefore begin
with the most usual soil of this
country, the dry, arable lands, which
are usually suited for a variety of
crops. Of the stiff clays, the hard
gravels, and light sands, soils which
abound but little here, we shall speak
in particular. In ploughing we shall
advise that the usual depth be about
six inches, or about a third deeper
than our farmers commonly plough:
but that the depth should sometimes
be greater than this, and sometimes
less. We shall also insist on the
ploughing being done in the most
perfect manner, and not in the slight
way too often practised; and we shall
farther premise that the plan of culture
we recommend is necessarily
connected with the business of the
dairy, to greater or less extent, and
with that of the grazier, in feeding
and fatting cattle of every description.
Such we conceive to be the only true
and profitable course to conduct farming
in this country, but deviations
from this may in some cases be found
equally profitable. In general, however,
we advise to this course of farming,
for in this way the greatest quantity
of manure is afforded, and for
most lands manure is essential for
obtaining the greatest crops, and of
course for realizing the greatest profits.</p>

<p>We shall begin with the ground in
wheat or rye stubble, as at the end
of our course we propose to leave it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Let the stubble ground be well turned
over in the fall, to the depth of,
say, six inches. It should not be
turned over until a sward of white
clover has covered the ground, which
is to be produced by giving it a top-dressing
of gypsum, in the spring.
Under the subject of manures the
reasons for this will be explained,
when treating of gypsum. In the
spring give the ground one or two
ploughings more, as the nature of
the soil may require, and of the same
depth, and let the last ploughing be
just before the proper time for planting
Indian corn; for this crop, with
an intermixture of other plants, is
what we propose to begin with. Say,
for instance, that the intermixture
shall consist of the potato, of the
pumpkin, and of the common pumpkin,
a third part of each. We propose
planting these crops in drills, in
preference to hills, from a well founded
conviction that in the former method
considerably more may be obtained
from the ground. Let furrows
be run, at a good depth, for the drills,
at the distance of about every three
and a half feet. In these furrows lay
off the shortest and best of the fresh
barn dung, at the rate of about 20
wagon loads to the acre. For the
drills intended for potatoes the longer
sort of barn dung is as good as any
other. If the different sorts of barn
dung can be applied to the soils most
suitable for each, as is mentioned in
speaking of manures; this should always
be attended to; that is, sheep
and horse dung for the moister parts
of the land, and cow dung for the
drier. As fast as the dung is laid, it
should be well covered, by a furrow,
moderately deep, thrown over it from
each side; but where potatoes are to
form the alternate drills, let the seed
for these be laid on the dung, previous
to covering; and for this purpose, let
the potatoes be cut in halves, lengthways,
so as to give each about an
equal number of eyes, and then wet
them and roll them in gypsum before
laying them down, which should be
at the distances of about 15 inches.
The potato drills being thus covered,
by the furrows thrown from each side,
the same process serves to cover the
dung in the other furrows, and thus
the beds are formed for planting the
other crops in the drill method. Indian
corn may be drilled in at one operation
by a drill machine for the purpose;
the same may be observed of
the turnip crop, and probably of the
pumpkin; but though attended with
more labour, it may usually be expected
that they will be drilled in by
manual operation. We should advise
that the seed in the turnip drills be
liberally strewn, in order that if part
of the plants be destroyed by the flies,
enough may still be left. The corn
and pumpkin seed may be dropped at
the distances of six inches, and thinned
at the first hoeing, so as to have
the growing plants of the former
about a foot apart, and the latter about
16 inches. If any vacant places should
happen in any of these drills, such vacancies
may readily be supplied by
transplanting sets, taken from parts
where more plants are standing than
are necessary. Any young plants may
be transplanted after they have attained
a suitable size, which is usually in
from two to four weeks growth. The
vacancies may be quickly filled by
transplanting, and it is a matter well
worthy of attention.</p>

<p>The practice, lately introduced, of
laying barn dung at a good depth, and
then covering it with mould to the
depth of about three or four inches,
and planting the seeds over the manure
thus covered, seems to answer
the best purpose for every drilled
crop except potatoes, and we would
therefore recommend this method of
using barn dung in preference to every
other, as far as it may be wanted
for drilled crops. In this way this
manure may be profitably applied
while fresh; but in many instances we
consider it more efficacious when applied
after the process of rotting or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
fermentation has commenced. Such
is the theory of Sir Humphrey Davy,
and we have full confidence in its correctness.
When thus buried in the
earth, the growing plants, placed above
the manure, have the utmost means of
absorbing all its garious and soluble
parts, while the process of its decomposition
is going on.</p>

<p>In preparing seeds we would, as a
general rule, advise to their being
soaked about 12 hours in a strong solution
of saltpetre, or of common salt,
and then rolled in gypsum before being
committed to the earth. The
effect of this mode of preparing the
seed seems to be, that the young
plants start with more vigour, and
grow larger than they do where this
treatment of the seed is neglected;
and the solution of saltpetre has the
further effect of bringing plants to
maturity from one to two weeks
sooner than they otherwise would
ripen.</p>

<p>In selecting seed for the corn crop,
take such stalks as bear two ears, and
select the best ear from each of such
stalks, the grains on each end to be
rejected. In all cases where it is
practicable, the seeds should be taken
from the largest and most perfect
plants, or roots, as the case may be.
By attending to this mode of selecting
seed the product of the corn crop in
particular will soon be found greatly
augmented; a discovery, the honour
of which is due to Mr. Cooper, of
New Jersey. It is said that sprinkling
a little gypsum on the silk of the
ears of corn, will make them fill to
the ends. Nipping off the blossoms
of the potato crop, as fast as they appear,
is found, by accurate experiment,
to increase the growth of the
roots about one sixth part. Salt and
gypsum have each a powerful effect
on their growth, though by applying
too much of the latter it may cause
them to run too much to vines. To
the corn and pumpkin crop apply
some of this latter manure after the
plants are up. What effect it has
on turnips we have never understood.</p>

<p>In ploughing between the drills let
it be to a good depth, first turning the
furrows from the plants, running about
four inches from them, and then turning
the furrows back, when the hoeing
and hand weeding are to follow.
The second ploughing should be similar
to the first, but farther from the
plants; and in general, we believe, it
will be found advantageous to plough
and hoe the crops the third time. We
have seen it highly recommended to
plough among Indian corn as late as
in August. Frequent deep ploughing
is certainly the best means of keeping
the ground moist, and should never
be omitted in case of drought. Ground
that has become quite dry will be
found moist after a thorough deep
ploughing. At all events, the ground
should be so cultivated as to prevent
any weeds from going to seed in the
fall, for if this be suffered, the ground
will remain constantly stocked with
the seeds of weeds.</p>

<p>We advise to the cultivation of the
common turnip, the potato, and the
pumpkin, in the manner we have
mentioned, for the purpose of affording
the early supply of food for feeding
and fatting cattle in the fall and
the forepart of the winter, before the
ruta baga crop should be used, of
which we shall presently speak. We
also advise to this variety of crops, in
order that the cattle may have a greater
variety of food, a matter of considerable
importance in feeding and fatting
cattle. For this purpose also the
culture of the cabbage is worthy of
attention. Horses, and all sorts of cattle,
fatten well on pumpkins, but for
swine they should be steam boiled,
and the seeds taken out, as these prove
injurious to those animals, by causing
too great a secretion of urine. The
seeds afford an oil equal to that of the
olive, and are well worth preserving
for this purpose.</p>

<p>As soon as the ears of the corn
crop have somewhat hardened, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
crop may be cut up and set in
shocks, with the tops tied closely together
to keep out the rains, in
which way the grain will harden as
well as in any other, and a great
addition of fodder may thus be acquired.</p>

<p>During the next season we propose
to take two crops from the ground, to
wit, a crop of ruta baga, preceded by
such spring crop as ripens sufficiently
early to be harvested in time for preparing
the ground for a full growth
of this root. In the meridian of New
York, Mr. Cobbett says that from the
26th of July until some of the first
days in August, is the proper time to
transplant this crop, the plants for the
purpose being previously grown. The
method of cultivating the crop by
transplanting, he insists, is the preferable
way, and from our own experience
we are fully disposed to agree
with him. Advancing to the northward,
from New York, the seasons
are shorter, and of course the crop
should be transplanted earlier, while
at the same time the spring crops are
later in ripening. At New York,
barley could be taken from the ground
in time sufficient for preparing for
ruta baga; farther to the north this
could not be the case. In the more
northerly parts of this state, it would,
perhaps, be difficult to find any crop,
now raised in this country, with the
exception of flax, that would be sufficiently
early. The fact is, we want a
particular crop for this purpose; and
that would seem to be the new sort
of spring wheat lately introduced into
France, which is there called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le ble
de Mai</i>, in English, the wheat of May.
It is said to be a very productive species
of wheat, affording a grain from
which flour is made of about a medium
whiteness between that of rye and
wheat, and in that country it is fit to
harvest in the latter end of May. In
this state it would probably ripen no
where later than the first of July,
which would be in time sufficient for
the crop of ruta baga. Until we can
procure this wheat, we can only recommend
that the preceding crop
be such only as will ripen sufficiently
early, and where none can be had
for the purpose, to be content with
raising the crop of ruta baga only in
the course of the season. Where
previous spring crops can however
be obtained, let them be taken from
the ground as quick as possible, and
the ground deeply turned over, and
mellowed by three deep ploughings,
then furrowed at the distances of
about 30 inches, the manure laid in,
and covered by furrows thrown over
it from each side, and the plants of
ruta baga immediately set on the
ridges, by transplanting, at the distance
of about a foot from each other.
From our own experience we are
fully convinced that the plan of transplanting
is, in the end, much the
cheapest, and most advisable. We
would, however, recommend not to
transplant before the appearance of
a heavy shower, but at any time afterwards;
that the plants be of good size,
say of five or six weeks growth, and
that in setting, special care be taken
to have the lower parts of the roots
well enclosed with earth. For further
particulars in regard to the culture
of this crop, the time and manner
of using it, and of saving it, we refer
the reader to Mr. Cobbett's book on
the subject, from a conviction that it
is the best essay that has ever been
published on the culture and use of
this valuable plant.</p>

<p>It will be seen, however, that we
differ from Mr. C. in the distances in
which the plants are to be set, and in
the manner of forming the ridges.
He forms his ridges by four gathering
furrows, by which the ridges are
each about 4 feet in breadth. We
propose to form the ridges by two
gathering furrows, and at the distances
of 30 inches. In England, the
plan we recommend is generally pursued,
and the ridges are usually but
27 inches wide.</p>

<p class="center">FROM NILES' WEEKLY REGISTER.</p>

<h2><i>Cotton, Rice, Tobacco, Sugar, Wine.</i></h2>


<p>The National Intelligencer informs
us that in New York 133 bushels of
Indian corn have been gathered this
year from <em>one acre</em>; and 714 bushels
of potatoes from one acre. This has
led to the following statistical facts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cotton.</span>&mdash;In 1817 the export of
cotton from the United States was
(85,649,328<i>lbs.</i>) more than eighty-five
million. One acre yields, at a moderate
estimate, 250lbs. of clean cotton.
The whole export, therefore, is the
product of only 535 square miles:
this is less than the 108th part of
Georgia, and less than the 520th part
of the cotton regions of the U. States.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rice.</span>&mdash;The maximum export of
rice was 73,329 tierces, (in 1790,) or
(43,997,400<i>lbs.</i>) nearly forty-four million
pounds. This, on an average
crop, is the produce of only sixty-five
square miles, which is less than the
440th part of South Carolina, and
less than two-thirds of the District of
Columbia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tobacco.</span>&mdash;The maximum export
of tobacco was 12,428 hogsheads, in
1791. A hogshead is about one thousand
weight; and, on average, one acre
will yield one hogshead. The export,
therefore, was the product of about
176 square miles, which is less than
the 363d part of Virginia. Each of
the 97 counties of that state contains,
on an average, more than 659 square
miles, viz: more than three times
the quantity of land which furnished
the above export.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sugar.</span>&mdash;Such is, generally, the
fertility of the equinoctial regions
of America, that all the sugar consumed
in France, estimated at twenty
million kilogrammes, (about
54,000,000 pounds,) may be produced
on an extent of 7 square leagues,
which is not equal to one-thirtieth
part of the smallest department of
France.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wine.</span>&mdash;About 1,600,000 arpents,
or 1,350,400 acres, are in France employed
in the culture of the vine.
The value of the annual product is
about 100,800,000 dollars, at about
twenty cents a gallon. In 1790 Bordeaux
alone exported more than fifteen
million gallons of wine. The
1,600,000 arpents are less than one
80th part of France, and less than
one 20th part of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The value of the annual produce
of these five interesting articles, may
be thus estimated:</p>

<p>This is little less than three-fourths
of the state of Connecticut.</p>

<p>The authority for cotton, rice, and
tobacco, is Seybert's Statistical Annals,
and the personal information of
gentlemen of experience in the culture
of those articles.</p>

<p>For sugar I have the authority of
Humboldt's <cite>Essai Politique</cite>.</p>

<p>For wine I depend on Chaptal:
his "Treatise, theoretical and practical,
on the culture of the vine, and
the art of making wine, brandy, spirits
of wine, and vinegars, simple and
compound," is a truly classic work,
in which he had the aid of Rozier,
Parmentier, and Dussieux. It contains
all that the chemist, or botanist,
or vine cultivator, or enlightened
statesman can reasonably ask or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
wish to know. It is in two octavo
volumes, of about 500 pages each,
with 21 plates.</p>

<p>This admirable treatise should be
translated for the use of our fellow
citizens who occupy our wine-yielding
regions. For, in a few years, the
United States will produce wine for
their domestic consumption and exportation.</p>

<p>A revolution of our planet on its
axis would present to the eye of an
observer, at the distance of a few
thousand miles, a few spots or specks
(China or Holland) fully cultivated.
The rest would be as a desert. Pauperism
in England, now so extensive
and so dangerous, is fulfilling the prophecies
of Goldsmith's Deserted Village.</p>

<p>"Political economy (says Jean Baptiste
Say,) is founded on statistical
knowledge, or (what is the same
thing) history;" and that "the American
confederacy will have the glory
of proving that the loftiest policy is
in accordance with moderation and
humanity."</p>

<p>The most active mind has not yet
conceived an adequate idea of the
vast resources of the United States.</p>

<h2>NOTES AND REMARKS&mdash;BY THE EDITOR OF
THE REGISTER.</h2>


<p>The <em>general</em> average value of the
products of the United States exported,
may be estimated as amounting
to 45,000,000 dollars, at fair prices;
the cotton, tobacco, and rice, included
in which, may be valued at
21,000,000&mdash;the balance is made up
of bread stuffs and meats, the product
of the forest and of the sea, and
2,000,000 in manufactures.</p>

<p>The chief things that we have for
<em>export</em> bear about the following proportions
to their respective quantities
<em>consumed</em> in the United States&mdash;assuming
45 millions as the amount
of value exported, and taking our
products at their average quantities.</p>

<p>The value of the cotton, tobacco,
and rice consumed in the United
States, being considered as included
in the aggregate values of the manufactures
used, or other stuffs consumed,
will give a value to the consumption
equal to 619, say 620 millions
of dollars per annum; and assuming
our population at 9,500,000,
the average for each individual is 65
dollars a-year. This amount includes
ALL sorts of disbursements needful
to the subsistence, convenience and
comfort of the people, except the
product of the value of labour directly
applied to the <em>erection</em> of buildings
or other permanent works. The
amount, though it appears enormous,
I am satisfied is less than the
actual value consumed. It brings out
the general result, that our exports
stand to our consumption as 45 is to
620&mdash;or as <em>one</em> is to <em>fourteen</em>, at the
present time. When the price of
commodities was higher, the rate was
as <em>one</em> to <em>seventeen</em>.</p>

<p>It would be excessively tedious to
attempt to detail the multitude of
items that affect these general conclusions.
Accuracy is not pretended
in either of them. Probabilities only
are aimed at.</p>

<p>From these facts assumed as being
pretty near the truth, we may estimate
the importance of the home
trade, or internal commerce and consumption
of the people, and arrive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
at a multitude of highly interesting
considerations. Take the following
for an example:</p>

<p>The sudden introduction of less
than 500,000 persons, would leave us
no surplus of <em>present</em> products of
food for men. But it is a demand
for this surplus, no matter how created,
that assesses the value of the
whole product. Such products, let
the fact be recollected, were at as
high prices during the late war, when
there was very little export of them,
as they are now, the difference in the
value of our circulating medium being
also considered. This was caused
by a partial want of agricultural labourers;
but more by the waste of
provisions that belong to a belligerent
state.</p>

<p>Foreign commerce, nevertheless,
has a powerful bearing on the consideration
of value in a state of peace,
to the growers of grain, meats, &amp;c.
The amount beyond their own <em>immediate</em>
consumption and that of their
families, may be about two fifths of
the whole, besides the foreign export,
or nearly 110 millions,&mdash;the <em>price</em> of
which is fixed by the small amount
of 13,500,000 dollars' worth sent
abroad! And, this little surplus remaining
unconsumed, or without being
wasted, at home, would depreciate
the general value of the whole
surplus at least 50 per cent. Hence,
it would seem of greater interest to
the farmers even to <em>destroy</em> a portion
of their products, than to cast them
into a glutted market, according to
the principles acted upon by the
Dutch in regard to spices. A policy
not to be recommended on the score
of morality, but as according with
the spirit of trade. It cannot, therefore,
be advantageous to the agriculturist
to depend upon a foreign market
to assess the value of his articles,
for it is, and ever must be uncertain
and unsteady. It is his interest
to have a market at home,
for this may be depended upon, and
the product will be regulated by
the demand, so as to leave a fair
profit.</p>

<p>A gentleman of observation, on a
certain occasion, when I Was speaking
on this subject, related the following
case in point.</p>

<p>At an interval of about 10 years,
he had stopped for a short time at a
certain village in Connecticut&mdash;when
first there, it contained two first rate
taverns, and one other respectable establishment
of the same kind. Two
lines of stages made it their halting
place every night, and all seemed
flourishing and lively. When there
again, the three taverns were shut up,
or at least not occupied as such, and
he had to apply at a private house to
be accommodated during his stay,
and every thing appeared dull and
desolate. He asked the reason.&mdash;It
was the establishment of steam-boats
which had destroyed the lines of stages,
and driven off the persons and
horses that they had given employment
to, and of course the market
they created, which hitherto took off
all the surplus products of the neighbourhood,
had ceased to be. A thousand
instances of this sort might be
noted to prove that a <em>ready market</em>
is the prosperity of a neighbourhood,
country, state, or nation.</p>

<p>On the different items, especially
those of <em>cotton</em> and <em>sugar</em>, as mentioned
by the writer in the National
Intelligencer, we intend to speak particularly
hereafter, in the essays we
have promised to write under the
head of "Political Economics," the

<h2><i>Political Economics.</i></h2>


<h3>INTRODUCTORY.</h3>

<p>Though so much has been said on
political economy as applicable to the
national prosperity, by profits derived
from national industry, that we despair
of offering any new thing on the
subject, we have so far yielded to the
wishes of many friends as to resolve
upon the publication of a new series
of essays, to elucidate some of the
facts that belong to this deeply interesting
concern&mdash;a concern that
presses itself into every man's business,
which invades our fire-sides
and accompanies us to our bed-chambers:
yet, so beset with it, and feeling
it in all that we have to sell or want
to buy, and in whatsoever business
we do that requires the aid of money
or use of credit&mdash;still we shrink from
the trouble of ascertaining its operation
and extent. The mind, by repeated
mortifications and disappointments,
loses its tone; and we seem
rather disposed to trust to the chapter
of accidents for redress, than rouse
ourselves to an exertion to put an
end to our wrongs, through the means
afforded; forgetting that effects flow
from causes.</p>

<p>It has pleased Providence to bless
us with a "goodly land," and we are
favoured with the best system of government
ever devised&mdash;but the seat
of ancient Paradise is a howling waste,
and Greece and Rome are tenanted
by slaves.</p>

<p>A nation's prosperity is the happiness
of the individuals composing it.
The freeman cannot be a happy man
unless private industry secures private
independence; and freedom itself
must pass into despotism. The
power of a government rests in the
moral and physical force of the governed,
and its wealth is constituted
by personal acquisitions of property.
Governments were made for the
good of the people, not the people
for governments; and their object
fails when private happiness ceases to
be respected. Emancipation from
political tyranny, without the means
of preserving personal liberty, is a
nullity. The gift of life without the
means of living, is destitute of value.</p>

<p>Production is the only source of
national wealth that can be depended
upon. The home market, even to
the most commercial nations, is of
many times the amount of the foreign
one. The former is not easily
effected, except by a self-mistaken
policy; but the latter is as capricious
as the winds, and beyond our control.
Speculation does not create value&mdash;the
purchase and sale of a million's
worth of goods does not improve
their quality or add to their quantity,
to the amount of a cent. A change
of commodities between different
countries, may increase their value
to the extent of the labour expended
in transporting them; and it is generally
convenient, if not advantageous,
when exchanges are made on equal
terms. But poverty must be the lot
of every society which barters the
labour of two or more of its members
for that of one person in another
society.</p>

<p>Employment is the best preservative
of health and morals. Things
should be so that every person willing
to labour for his living, should
find labour to do, and live plentifully.
If it is otherwise, an error has been
committed that ought to be corrected
immediately, for it is pregnant
with the greatest evils. It is the
chief check to population, and more
powerful than the sword to destroy
the liberties of nations. Nations and
individuals are spendthrifts of the
worst description when they purchase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
that which they can make from the
spare labour at home. Who will
give away a hundred dollars and their
interest for ever, for the sake of receiving
twenty dollars of his own
money as a premium? Yet thus a
nation acts when, for the sake of the
duties on imports, it accepts of another
nation any commodity which it
might supply itself with, without
detriment to its other branches of industry.</p>

<p>Agriculture is the noblest and best
occupation of man; and in a country
like the United States, where land is
plenty and labour scarce, it will always
be pushed to the extent which
a profitable market demands. Yet
if none worked but those who laboured
in the field, society could not exist
long. We should perish with cold
and hunger. It is by an association
of the arts that we live&mdash;and our
comfort materially depends on their
respective perfections. Only about
one fifth of a population are fitted for
agricultural labours, in general. The
other four fifths, if idle would consume
the whole amount of value produced,
and send the labourers supperless
to bed. It is the capacity of production
in the most numerous body
that must be brought into action, if
families and nations would prosper
and be happy. If they purchase any
thing which their lost time might be
applied to the fabrication of&mdash;they
might as well throw its cost into the
sea.</p>

<p>In the course of our essays, which
we expect to commence in two or
three weeks, we shall endeavour to
point out some of the chief things
that require the protection of government,
just as those of a well regulated
family are managed; and
shew that the well being of a nation
depends upon a fair exchange of labour
for labour, substantials for substantials,
and even luxuries for luxuries.
The man who exchanges wheat
for <em>ear-rings</em>, unless those rings are
manufactured in his country, wastes
to the country the whole amount of
the <em>intrinsic</em> value of the wheat over
that of the <em>ear-rings</em>, which latter is
only that of the metal composing
them. A nation cannot be independent,
if it looks to another for necessaries&mdash;it
cannot be rich, if it exchanges
necessaries for luxuries. And
luxuries, especially, should not be
received at all, unless things of the
same class are remitted in payment
for them. The effect of these on
population and manners, will also be
considered, and illustrated by many
statistical facts&mdash;as leisure is allowed
to arrange them.</p>

<h2>FROM HUMBOLDT'S PERSONAL NARRATIVE.</h2>


<h3><i>The Coffee Plant.</i></h3>

<p>The coffee tree flowers only the
second year, and the flowering lasts
only twenty-four hours. At this time
the shrub has a charming aspect;
seen from afar, it seems covered with
snow. The produce of the third year
becomes very abundant. In plantations
well weeded and watered, and
recently cultivated, we find trees
bearing sixteen, eighteen, and even
twenty pounds of coffee. In general,
however, a produce of more than a
pound and a half or two pounds cannot
be expected from each plant; and
even this is superior to the mean produce
of the West India Islands.
Rains at the time of the flowering,
the want of water for artificial irrigations,
and a patastic plant, a new
species of coranthus, which clings to
the branches, are extremely injurious
to the coffee trees.</p>


<h3><i>Sugar Cane.</i></h3>

<p>Three species of sugar cane can
be distinguished even at a distance,
by the colour of their leaves; the
ancient Creole sugar cane, the Otaheite
cane, and the Batavia cane.
The first has a leaf of a deeper green,
the stem less thick, and the knots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
nearer together.&mdash;This sugar cane
was the first introduced from India
into Sicily, the Canary Islands and
the West Indies. The second is of
a lighter green; and its stem is higher,
thicker, and more succulent. The
whole plant displays a more luxuriant
vegetation. We owe this plant
to the voyages of Bougainville, Cook,
and Bligh. Bougainville carried it
to the Isle of France, whence it passed
to Cayenne, Martinique, and since
1792, to the rest of the West India
Islands. The sugar cane of Otaheite,
the <em>To</em> of those islanders, is one
of the most important acquisitions,
for which colonial agriculture is indebted
to the travels of naturalists.
It yields not only one third more of
juice than the Creolian cane on the
same space of land; but from the
thickness of its stem, and the tenacity
of its ligneous fibres, it furnishes
much more fuel. The last advantage
is important to the West Indies,
where the destruction of the forests
has for a long time obliged the planters
to use the canes deprived of their
juice, to keep up the fire under their
boilers.</p>

<p>But from the knowledge of this
new plant, the progress of agriculture
on the continent of Spanish
America, and the introduction of the
East India and Java sugars, the revolutions
of St. Domingo, and the destruction
of the great sugar plantations
of that island, would have had
a more sensible effect on the prices
of colonial produce in Europe. The
Otaheite sugar cane was carried from
the Isle of Trinidad to Caraccas.
From Caraccas it passed to Cicuta
and San Gil in the kingdom of New
Grenada. In our days its cultivation
during twenty-five years almost entirely
removed the apprehension,
which was at first entirely entertained,
that, transplanted to America,
the plant would by degrees degenerate,
and become as slender as the
Creole cane. If it be a variety, it is
a very constant one. The third species,
the violet sugar cane, called <i>Cana
de Batavia</i>, or <i>de Guinea</i>, is entirely
indigenous in the island of Java,
where it is cultivated in preference in
the districts of Jupara and Pasuruan.
Its foliage is purple, and very broad;
and it is preferred in the province of
Caraccas for rum. The <i>tablones</i>, or
grounds planted with sugar canes, are
divided by hedges of a collossal gramen;
the latta, or gynesium with distich
leaves.</p>


<h3><i>American Fig Tree</i>.</h3>

<p>The trunks of these trees are covered
with very odoriferous plants of
vanilla, which, in general, flower only
in the month of April.&mdash;We were
here again struck with those ligneous
excrescenses, which in the form
of ridges, or ribs, augment, in so extraordinary
a manner, and as far as
twenty feet above the ground, the
thickness of the trunk of the fig trees
of America. I found trees twenty-two
feet and a half in diameter near
the roots.&mdash;These ligneous ridges
sometimes separate from the trunk
at a height of eight feet, and are
transformed into cylindrical roots two
feet thick. The tree looks as if it
were supported by buttresses. This
scaffolding, however, does not penetrate
very deep into the earth. The
lateral roots wind at the surface of the
ground, and when at twenty feet distance
from the trunk, they are cut
with the hatchet, we see the milky
juice of the fig tree gush out, which,
when deprived of the vital influence
of the organs of the tree, is altered
and coagulates. What a wonderful
combination of cells and vessels exist
in these vegetable masses; in these
gigantic trees of the torrid zone,
which, without interruption, perhaps
during a thousand years, prepare nutritious
fluids, raise them to the height
of 180 feet, convey them down again
to the ground, and conceal beneath
a rough and hard bark, under the
inanimate layers of ligneous matter,
all the movements of organic life!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>The Cow Tree.</i></h3>

<p>"Amid the great number of curious
phenomena which have presented
themselves to me in the course of
my travels, I confess there are few
that have so powerfully affected my
imagination, as the aspect of the cow
tree.</p>

<p>"Whatever relates to milk, whatever
regards corn, inspires an interest,
which is not merely that of the
physical knowledge of things, but
is connected with another order of
ideas and sentiments. We can scarcely
conceive how the human race
could exist without farinaceous substances,
and without that nourishing
juice which the breast of the mother
contains, and which is appropriated
to the long feebleness of the
infant. The amylaceous matter of
corn, the object of religious veneration
among so many nations, ancient
and modern, is diffused in the seeds
and deposited in the roots of vegetables;
milk, which serves us as an
aliment, appears to us exclusively the
produce of animal organization.&mdash;Such
are the impressions we have
received in our earliest infancy; such
is also the source of that astonishment
which seizes us at the aspect
of the tree just described. It has not
here the solemn shades of forests,
the majestic course of rivers, the
mountains wrapped in eternal frosts,
that excite our emotion.&mdash;A few
drops of vegetable juice recal to our
minds all the powerfulness and fecundity
of nature. On the barren flank
of rock grows a tree with coriaceous
and dry leaves. Its large woody roots
can scarcely penetrate into the stone.
For several months of the year not a
single shower moistens its foliage. Its
branches appear dead and dried; but
when its trunk is pierced, there flows
from it a sweet and nourishing milk.
It is at the rising of the sun that this
vegetable fountain is most abundant.
The blacks and natives are then seen
hastening from all quarters, furnished
with large bowls to receive the
milk, which grows yellow, and thickens
at its surface. Some employ
their bowls under the tree itself,
others carry the juice home to their
children. We seem to see the family
of a shepherd, who distributes the
milk to his flock.</p>

<p>"I have described the sensation
which the cow tree awakens in the
mind of the traveller, at the first
view. In examining the physical properties
of animal and vegetable products,
science displays them as closely
linked together; but it strips them
of what is marvellous, and perhaps
also a part of their charms, of what
excited our astonishment.&mdash;Nothing
appears insolated; the chemical principles
that were believed to be peculiar
to animals are found in plants;
a common chain links together all organic
nature."</p>

<h2><i>Singular effect of Peruvian Bark.</i></h2>


<p>A French merchant, at Guayra,
named Delpech, in 1806, had occasion
to receive several travellers, inhabitants
of those countries. The
apartments destined for visitors being
filled, and the number of his
guests increasing, he was under the
necessity of putting several of them
in rooms occupied by <i>cinchona</i>. Each
of them contained from 8 to 10 thousand
pounds of that bark. One of
his guests was ill of a very malignant
fever. After the first day he
found himself much better, though
he had taken no medicine; but he
was surrounded with an atmosphere
of cinchona which appeared very
agreeable to him. In a few days he
felt himself quite recovered without
any medical treatment whatever.
This unexpected success led M. Delpech
to make some other trials. Several
persons, ill of fever, were placed
successively in his magazine of cinchona,
and they were all speedily
cured, simply by the effluvia of the
bark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>In the same place with the cinchona,
he kept a bale of coffee, and some
bottles of common French brandy. In
some time M. Delpech, when visiting
his magazine, observed one of
the large bottles uncorked. He suspected
at first the fidelity of a servant,
and determined to examine the
quality of the brandy. What was his
astonishment to find it infinitely superior
to what it had been!&mdash;A slightly
aromatic taste added to its strength,
and rendered it more tonic and more
agreeable. Curious to know if the
coffee had likewise changed its properties,
he opened the bale, and roasted
a portion of it. It was more bitter
and left in the mouth a taste similar
to that of the effluvia of bark.&mdash;The
bark which produced these singular
effects was fresh. Would the cinchona
of commerce have the same efficacy?</p>

<h2><i>Oil of Pumpkin Seed.</i></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">C. S. Kapinesque</span>, Esq. to Doct. <span class="smcap">Samuel
Mitchell</span>.</p>

<p class="sig"><i>New York, 20th Feb. 1819.</i></p>


<p>While I was at Harmony, on the
banks of the Wabash, in the state of
Indiana, last summer, I was told by
the industrious German Society of
the Harmonites, that instead of throwing
away or giving to the pigs the
seeds of their pumpkins, as is usually
done all over the country, they collected
them and made an oil from
them which they use for all the purposes
of lamp oil and olive oil. It is
well known, that all the different species
and varieties of pumpkins (genus
<i>cuburbita</i> Linnæus) afford an oil which
has valuable medical properties, possessing
in the highest degree the refrigerative
quality; but I had never
heard before of its being made on
a large scale, and for economical uses.</p>

<p>It will be sufficient to mention this
fact to some of our enlightened farmers,
to induce them to imitate the
worthy Harmonites, and I recommend
highly the practice, as likely to become
eminently beneficial. The
pumpkin seeds afford their oil with
the greatest facility and abundance.
One gallon of seeds will give about
half a gallon of oil. They may be
pressed like rape and flax seed.&mdash;Their
oil is clear, limpid pale, scentless,
and when used for salad instead
of sweet oil, has merely a faint insipid
taste; it burns well, and without
smoke. Those advantages entitle it
to our attention, as an indigenous production
of first necessity. Pumpkins
grow all over the United States, from
Maine to Louisiana, and with such
luxuriance, as to produce sometimes
as much as 50,000<i>lbs.</i> weight of fruits,
and about 2000 <i>lbs.</i> weight of seeds,
in one acre of Indian corn without
injuring the crop of corn. Those
2000 <i>lbs.</i> of seeds might produce
about 200 gallons of oil, worth about
200 dollars. I calculate that about
two millions of gallons of such oil
could be made annually in the United
States, from the seeds that are wasted
or given to cattle and pigs. This is
worth saving&mdash;and in addition to the
bread, pies, soups, dishes, feed, &amp;c.
afforded by pumpkins, we shall have
a good and wholesome home-made
vegetable oil for lamps and food.</p>

<h2><i>Disease among Horses.</i></h2>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Mifflintown</span>, (Penn.) Nov. 20.</p>


<p>A disease prevails among the horses
in this part of the country, by some
called the Burnt Tongue. We understand
that it originated in the western
section of this state, and has extended
along this route from Pittsburg
to Philadelphia. It has in a few instances
proved fatal: but we understand
that the stages west of the Alleghany
have been stopped, and numbers
of wagonners are obliged to lie
by in consequence of it. It affects the
tongue and prevents the creature
from eating, and is very catching, so
much so, that it is said a beast will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
take it in consequence of its having
been <em>hitched</em> at the same place that
the one has stood which was affected.</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Lancaster</span>, (Penn.) Nov. 23.</p>

<p>The following method of practice
and recipe for the care of the prevailing
disease among horses, called
<em>sore mouth</em>, was obtained from Mr.
Tomlinson, (one of the proprietors of
the Western Mail Stages) on his return
from visiting the sick horses in
the line, and I am authorized to say,
will, if strictly attended to, succeed
in curing in 99 <em>cases in</em> 100&mdash;by inserting
it you will oblige    <span class="smcap">Many</span>.</p>


<h3>RECIPE.</h3>

<p>On the commencement of the disease,
bleed moderately. If the blood,
after cooling, appears to have much
buff on it, repeat the bleeding; give
a pint of castor oil; if it does not operate
in 16 hours, give two thirds of a
pint. Nitre may be given at the rate
of 2 <i>oz</i>. a day, or salts two or three
times a week; <sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>4</small></sub> <i>lb.</i> at a time. These
may be given in a thin mash, or rather
slop of bran, it being the best
food for the animal while diseased.</p>

<p>Take half a pint of honey, one table
spoonful of borax, and one quart
of strong sage tea. Mix them well
together; then take a stick and tie a
soft rag to the end of it, dip it in the
mixture, and wash the tongue, gums
and mouth well; the more frequent
the better, at least every two hours.
Sweet milk in the tea will do no harm,
or a little nitre may occasionally be
put in it with good effect. Be particular
in keeping the mouth clean and
nursing the horse with care.</p>

<p>The pulse and appearance of the
blood must govern as to the necessity
of bleeding more than once.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><i>The Arabian Horse</i>.</h2>


<p>This noble animal, which lately arrived
in the ship Horatio, has been
sold for <em>four thousand dollars</em>, to
Messrs. Allison and Van Ranst, and
has been conveyed to Long Island.</p>


<h3><i>Wild Horse of the West.</i></h3>

<p>The horse of the Columbia River
will rank with the finest of his species
in the known world. His size is fifteen
or sixteen hands, even in a state
of nature, unprovided with food or
shelter by the hands of man. His
form exhibits much bone and muscle,
but not the mass of flesh which is
found on the fat European horse.&mdash;His
limbs are clean and slender; the
neck arched and rising; the hoofs
round and hard; and the nostrils wide
and thin. He is equally distinguished
for speed and bottom. He runs
rapidly, and for a long time; rivalling,
in this respect, all that we have
heard of the English hunting horses.
In other respects&mdash;in the docility of
his nature, in his capacity to sustain
hunger and hardship, in his powers to
provide food for himself and his master,
he is wholly unrivalled. He is
readily trained to the business of his
master's life, that of hunting, and pursues
the game with all the keenness
of the dog, and with equal sagacity
and more success. He will run down
the deer in the <em>prairies</em>, with or without
his master on his back, and, when
overtaken, will hold it with his teeth.
When rode after game he needs no
guiding of the bridle to direct him.
He will pursue a drove of buffaloes,
and, coming up with them, will stop
one by biting him with his teeth. The
animal bitten, immediately wheels to
defend himself with his horns; the
horse wheels at the same instant to
avoid it; and at this moment, when
the side of the buffalo is presented,
the Indian lets fly an arrow, which
often passes entirely through his body.
The wounded animal always
turns out of the drove to lay down
and die. The horse and his rider pursue
the gang to make fresh slaughter.
Another horse trained to a second part
of the game, with other Indians, take
the trail of the wounded buffalo,
which is butchered and carried into
camp. These things seem incredibel;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
but we have them upon the authority
of Lewis and Clarke, and a
great number of traders who have
been upon the Columbia river since
the time of their discovery; some of
whom are now in this town.</p>

<p>The capacity of this horse to sustain
fatigue, and to provide food for
himself, is equally astonishing. He
is galloped all day, sometimes 80 or
90 miles in the space of 10 or 12
hours, and is then left to shift for himself
during the night. In the spring,
summer and autumn, he finds no difficulty;
the short and sweet grass of
that country gives him an abundant
and nutricious repast. In the winter,
and towards the mountains, where the
snow is several feet deep, his unerring
instinct tells him where to search; he
scrapes away the snow with his hoof
till he comes to the ground, and rooting
there with his nose, finds wherewith
of moss and grass to sustain his
life. On the borders of creeks and
rivers he feeds on the boughs of willows,
and other soft wood, which his
master has sometimes the kindness to
fell for him with a hatchet.</p>

<p>This fine animal is found on the
banks of the Columbia, in latitude 46,
in the great plain which lies on the
borders of this river, between the upper
and lower range of mountains.
His origin is traced to Mexico, thence
to Spain, thence to the North of Africa,
where the Arabian barb is found
in all the perfection of his species.
His fine form, his generous spirit, and
his noble qualities, are preserved upon
the Columbia river; and certainly
it is worthy the experiment to endeavour
to transplant him into other parts
of the United States. Many citizens
have attempted to do so; but have
always been robbed by the Indians of
the Rocky Mountains. Lewis and
Clarke procured 73, said by Gov.
Clark to be the most beautiful collection
of horses that he has ever
seen together before or since; but the
whole number was stolen from them
by Indians, who followed their trail,
and never ceased their operations until
they had carried off the last.</p>

<h2>JAMES WATT.</h2>

<h3>(Ascribed to an eminent writer.)</h3>


<p>Death is still busy in our high
places; and it is with great pain
that we find ourselves called upon,
so soon after the loss of Mr. Playfair,
to record the decease of another
of our illustrious countrymen, and one
to whom mankind has been still more
largely indebted. Mr. James Watt,
the great improver of the steam-engine,
died on the 25th ult. at his seat
of Heathfield, near Birmingham, in
the 84th year of his age.</p>

<p>This name, fortunately, needs no
commemoration of ours; for he that
bore it survived to see it crowned with
undisputable and unenvied honours;
and many generations will probably
pass away before it shall have "gathered
all its fame." We have said
that Mr. Watt was the great <em>improver</em>
of the steam-engine; but, in truth,
as to all that is admirable in its structure,
or vast in its utility, he should
rather be described as its <em>inventor</em>.
It was by his inventions that its action
was so regulated as to make it capable
of being applied to the finest
and most delicate manufactures, and
its power so increased as to set weight
and solidity at defiance. By his admirable
contrivances, it has become a
thing stupendous alike for its force
and its flexibility; for the prodigious
power which it can exert, and the ease
and precision, and ductility, with which
they can be varied, distributed, and
applied. The trunk of an elephant
that can pick up a pin or rend an oak
is nothing to it. It can engrave a seal,
and crush masses of obdurate metal
like wax before it, draw out, without
breaking, a thread as fine as a gossamer,
and lift up a ship of war like a
bauble in the air. It can embroider
muslin and forge anchors, cut steel
into ribbands, and impel loaded vessels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
against the fury of the winds and
waves.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to estimate the
value of the benefits which these inventions
have conferred upon the
country. There is no branch of industry
that has not been indebted to
them; and in all the most material,
they have not only widened most magnificently
the field of its exertions, but
multiplied a thousand fold the amount
of its productions. It is our improved
steam-engine which now enables us
to pay the interest of our debt, and
to maintain the arduous struggle in
which we are still engaged, with the
skill and capital of countries less oppressed
with taxation. But these are
poor and narrow views of its importance.
It has increased indefinitely
the mass of human comforts and enjoyments,
and rendered cheap and accessible
all over the world the materials
of wealth and prosperity. It
has armed the feeble hand of man,
in short, with a power to which no
limits can be assigned, completed the
dominion of mind over the most refractory
qualities of matter, and laid
a sure foundation for all those future
miracles of mechanic power, which
are to aid and reward the labours of
after generations. It is to the genius
of one man too that all this is mainly
owing; and certainly no man ever before
bestowed such a gift on his kind.
The blessing is not only universal,
but unbounded; and the fabled inventors
of the plough and the loom,
who were deified by the erring gratitude
of their rude contemporaries,
conferred less important benefits on
mankind than the inventor of our present
steam-engine.</p>

<p>This will be the fame of Watt with
future generations; and it is sufficient
for his race and his country. But to
those to whom he more immediately
belonged, who lived in his society and
enjoyed his conversation, it is not, perhaps,
the character in which he will
be most frequently recalled&mdash;most
deeply lamented&mdash;or even most highly
admired. Independently of his great
attainments in mechanics, Mr. Watt
was an extraordinary, and in many respects,
a wonderful man. Perhaps
no individual in his age possessed so
much and such varied and exact information&mdash;had
read so much, or remembered
what he had read so accurately
and so well. He had infinite
quickness of apprehension, a prodigious
memory, and a certain rectifying
and methodising power of understanding,
which extracted something
precious out of all that was presented
to it. His stores of miscellaneous
knowledge were immense&mdash;and yet
less astonishing than the command he
had at all times over them. It seemed
as if every subject that was casually
started in conversation with him,
had been that which he had been last
occupied in studying and exhausting;
such was the copiousness, the precision,
and the admirable clearness of
the information which he poured out
upon it without effort or hesitation.
Nor was this promptitude and compass
of knowledge confined in any degree
to the studies connected with his
ordinary pursuits. That he should
have been minutely and extensively
skilled in chemistry and the arts, and
in most of the branches of physical
science, might perhaps have been conjectured;
but it could not have been
inferred from his usual occupations,
and probably is not generally known,
that he was curiously learned in many
branches of antiquity, metaphysics,
medicine, and etymology, and perfectly
at home in all the details of
architecture, music, and law. He
was well acquainted too with most of
the modern languages, and familiar
with their most recent literature. Nor
was it at all extraordinary to hear the
great mechanician and engineer detailing
and expounding, for hours together,
the metaphysical theories of
the German logicians, or criticising
the measures or the matter of the
German poetry.</p>

<p>His astonishing memory was aided,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
no doubt, in a great measure, by a still
higher and rarer faculty&mdash;by his power
of digesting and arranging in its
proper place all the information he
received, and of casting aside and rejecting,
as it were instinctively, whatever
was worthless or immaterial.
Every conception that was suggested
to his mind seemed instantly to take
its place among its other rich furniture,
and to be condensed into the
smallest and most convenient form.
He never appeared, therefore, to be
at all incumbered or perplexed with
the verbiage of the dull books he perused,
or the idle talk to which he listened;
but to have at once extracted,
by a kind of intellectual alchemy, all
that was worthy of attention, and to
have reduced it to his own use, to its
true value and to its simplest form.
And thus it often happened, that a
great deal more was learned from his
brief and vigorous account of the theories
and arguments of tedious writers,
than an ordinary student could
ever have derived from the most
faithful study of the originals; and that
errors and absurdities became manifest
from the mere clearness and
plainness of his statement of them,
which might have deluded and perplexed
most of his hearers without
that invaluable assistance.</p>

<p>It is needless to say, that with those
vast resources, his conversation was at
all times rich and instructive in no ordinary
degree; but it was, if possible,
still more pleasing than wise, and had
all the charms of familiarity, with all
the substantial treasures of knowledge.
No man could be more social
in his spirit, less assuming or fastidious
in his manners, or more kind
and indulgent towards all who approached
him. He rather liked to
talk, at least in his latter years; but
though he took a considerable share of
the conversation, he rarely suggested
the topics on which it was to turn,
but readily and quickly took whatever
was presented by those around
him, and astonished the idle and barren
propounders of an ordinary theme,
by the treasures which he drew from
the mine which they had unconsciously
opened. He generally seemed, indeed,
to have no choice or predilection
for one subject of discourse rather
than another, but allowed his
mind, like a great cyclopædia, to be
opened at any letter his associates
might choose to turn up, and only
endeavoured to select from his inexhaustible
stores what might be best
adapted to the taste of his present
hearers. As to their capacity, he
gave himself no trouble; and, indeed,
such was his singular talent for
making all things plain, clear, and
intelligible, that scarcely any one
could be aware of such a deficiency
in his presence. His talk, too,
though overflowing with information,
had no resemblance to lecturing
or solemn discoursing, but, on
the contrary, was full of colloquial
spirit and pleasure. He had a certain
quiet and grave humour, which
ran through most of his conversation,
and a vein of temperate jocularity,
which gave infinite zest and effect
to the condensed and inexhaustible
information which formed its main
staple and characteristic. There was
a little air of affected testiness, and a
tone of pretended rebuke and contradiction,
with which he used to address
his younger friends, that was always
felt by them as an endearing mark of
his kindness and familiarity, and prized
accordingly far beyond all the
solemn compliments that ever proceeded
from the lips of authority.
His voice was deep and powerful,
though he commonly spoke in a
low and somewhat monotonous tone,
which harmonized admirably with the
weight and brevity of his observations,
and set off to the greatest advantage
the pleasant anecdotes which he delivered
with the same grave brow and
the same calm smile playing soberly
on his lips. There was nothing of effort
indeed, or impatience, any more than
of pride or levity, in his demeanour;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and there was a finer expression of
reposing strength, and mild self-possession
in his manner, than we ever
recollect to have met with in any
other person. He had in his character
the utmost abhorrence for all sorts
of forwardness, parade and pretensions;
and, indeed, never failed to put
all such impostors out of countenance,
by the manly plainness and honest intrepidity
of his language and deportment.</p>

<p>In his temper and dispositions he
was not only kind and affectionate,
but generous and considerate of the
feelings of all around him, and gave
the most liberal assistance and encouragement
to all young persons who
showed any indications of talent, or
applied to him for patronage or advice.
His health, which was delicate
from his youth upwards, seemed to
become firmer as he advanced in
years; and he preserved, up almost
to the last moment of his existence,
not only the full command of his extraordinary
intellect, but all the alacrity
of spirit, and the social gaiety
which had illuminated his happiest
days. His friends in this part of the
country never saw him more full of
intellectual vigour and colloquial animation,
never more delightful or instructive,
than in his last visit to Scotland,
in autumn, 1817. Indeed, it
was after that time that he applied
himself, with all the ardour of early
life, to the invention of a machine for
mechanically copying all sorts of
sculpture and statuary, and distributed
among his friends some of its earliest
performances, as the productions
of a young artist just entering on his
83d year.</p>

<p>This happy and useful life came at
last to a gentle close. He had suffered
some inconveniences through the
summer; but was not seriously indisposed
till within a few weeks from his
death. He then became perfectly
aware of the event which was approaching;
and with his usual tranquillity
and benevolence of nature,
seemed only anxious to point out to
the friends around him the many
sources of consolation, which were
afforded by the circumstances under
which it was about to take place.
He expressed his sincere gratitude to
Providence for the length of days
with which he had been blessed, and
his exemption from most of the infirmities
of age, as well as for the
calm and cheerful evening of life
that he had been permitted to enjoy,
after the honourable labours of the
day had been concluded. And thus,
full of years and honours, in all calmness
and tranquillity he yielded up
his soul, without pang or struggle,
and passed from the bosom of his family
to that of his God!</p>

<p>He was twice married, but has left
no issue but one son, long associated
with him in his business and studies,
and two grand-children by a daughter
who predeceased him. He was a fellow
of the Royal Societies both of London
and Edinburgh, and of the few
Englishmen who were elected members
of the National Institute of
France. All men of learning and
science were his cordial friends;
and such was the influence of his
mild character and perfect fairness
and liberality, even upon the pretenders
to these accomplishments, that he
lived to disarm even envy itself, and
died, we verily believe, without a single
enemy.</p>

the monopoly of small farms by the

England, by having thrown too great
a mass of the population into the

<h2><i>Light without Heat or Combustion.</i></h2>

<h3>EXTRACT OF A LETTER.</h3>


<p>"I have lately seen an account of a
discovery of a singular and highly
important character, announced in
the latter part of August, at Paris,
by a Professor <em>Meinike</em>, (a German
probably) viz. an artificial <em>gas</em>, confined
in <em>glass</em>, assuming, by the electric
shock, a permanent, steady light,
without <em>heat</em> or <em>combustion</em>!</p>

<p>"Here is a grand desideratum, indeed&mdash;a
candle which can be thrust
into <em>carded cotton</em> innoxious, or into
a cistern of water unextinguished;
which can be placed under one's pillow
while we sleep, and taken out at
pleasure. Our houses may be built
with it in such a manner as to avoid
the necessity of those cold holes of
winter&mdash;windows.</p>

<p>"The whale may keep his <em>blubber</em>,
and the shark his <em>liver</em>; the coasts
of the ocean may be lined with those
newly discovered (<i>Pharoi</i>) light
bearers; they may be sunk on reefs,
and <em>shine</em> up <em>information</em> through the
deep; and, by anchoring them in lines
through oceans, we may mark the
<em>ship road</em>, and have <em>guide posts</em> which
tell the best path, for each month in
the year, across the parallels of this

I assure you that I have often entertained
the idea that an insulated mass
of <em>electron</em>, (according to Augustus
B. Woodward,) or some <em>phosphorus</em>,
might be produced in a permanently
useful form. We now <em>bottle</em> up <em>lightning</em>&mdash;we

we see our way by peeping at
the skies, or into a box, (mariner's

of <em>polar essence</em>, to steer by,
&amp;c. You recollect that, in 1799, a
hearty laugh was raised against the
democrats, by comparing them to the
philosopher of Lugghagg, extracting
<em>sunbeams from cucumbers</em>. Dean
Swift would have put into his philosophical
<em>whim-whams</em> the bottling
of lightning, together with the extracting
of sun-beams from cucumbers,
had he thought of it, or known
that it was ever dreamed of. May

<h2><i>Fire-Places</i>.</h2>



<h3><span class="smcap">FROM THE DOWNINGSTON REPUBLICAN.</span></h3>


<p><i>Fire-places</i>, for warming rooms,
have been for a long time in use;
and the best plan for constructing
them continues to be an interesting
subject of investigation.</p>

<p>Whether or not fire-places and
chimneys are of very ancient date,
and mentioned by Virgil Appian,
and Aristophanes, or whether they
are of more modern invention, is not
of much practical importance; and
may be left to philosophers to determine.
But as the proper construction
of a chimney and fire-place is
one of the greatest comforts of domestic
life, I cannot doubt but that
government will grant me a handsome
premium for making public an
unerring rule by which they can be
so built as never to fail of drawing
well, without emitting any smoke into
the apartment. When the principle
was first discovered by me, I wondered
how it could so happen, that
we had any defective chimnies
amongst us; for I remembered to
have heard that Dr. Franklin and
count Rumford had devoted much
attention to this subject, and must, of
course, as I thought, have discovered
a principle so plain and self-evident;
and consequently, every mechanic
must have learnt it, as not
they only were interested in it, but
every one of the civilized world.&mdash;After
thinking of it in this way, I took
an opportunity of inquiring into their
opinions, and I find that the principle
was never new to either of them;
and as far as I know, I am the first
and only discoverer of it. The principle
consists simply in making the
size of the flue bear a certain proportion
to the size of the fire-place in
front. To ascertain what would be
the smallest proportion which the flue
would bear to the front of the fire-place,
would require some experiments.
But it is probable that a fire-place
2<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> feet square in front, would
draw well enough to carry up all the
smoke, by a flue 12 by 14 inches, and
probably by a one foot square: or
even less may probably do.</p>

<p>If one foot square, would carry all
the smoke of such a fire-place, the
proportion would be 144 to 900, or
a little more than <sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>7</small></sub>, and a little less
than <sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>6</small></sub>. But for greater certainty, we
will say <sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>5</small></sub> is the proper proportion,
and that a flue to a fire-place 2<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> feet
square, shall be 12 by 15 inches. If
the front be twice that size, (3 feet 6
and near a half square) then the flue
or chimney must be 12 by 30 inches,
or near 19 inches square. If it be
three times the first size, or near 4
feet 4 inches square, then the flue
must be 12 by 45&mdash;15 by 36, or nearly
23<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>4</small></sub> inches square. Or if it be four
times the size of the first, or 5 feet
square, the flue must be equal to
nearly 27 inches square, and so accordingly,
whatever may be the dimensions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of the fire-place in front.
I do not know that a lesser proportion
would not do: and whatever experience
may establish, as that best
adapted to answer the end proposed,
it will not invalidate the principle laid
down, but confirm it. One thing,
however, is true, that the smaller the
fire-place is in proportion to the flue,
the harder it will draw, and by being
thus proportioned, it may have any
degree of draught given to it at pleasure,
from that of an air furnace to
that which will scarcely draw up the
smoke. Any one may convince himself
of the truth of this doctrine, by
taking a board and closing up the
fire-place, downwards from the mantle,
and in proportion as it diminishes
by the board moving downwards, the
power of its draught will be increased.
Franklin was aware of this fact,
but was ignorant of the principle on
which it depended, as he supposed
the height of the chimney, and not
its dimensions governed the fact itself,&mdash;and
hence mentions that the
higher the chimney, the larger the
opening may be: and that 2<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> feet
square may be risked on a lower floor
and 1<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> on the upper, &amp;c. The common
ten plate stove furnishes an example
of the truth of this principle:
when the large fire door is open, the
stove will smoke, because the large
door is an over proportion in size to
the size of the pipe&mdash;but shut the
large door and leave the small one
open, the stove immediately draws
like a furnace, because its area is
smaller than the area of a section of
the pipe. If it were true that 2<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> feet
square was the largest size which
could be made to draw well, it would
indeed be an unfortunate fact, as we
could never have a comfortable kitchen
fire-place&mdash;but if the principle
here laid down be true, we can, with
equal certainty, build a fire-place ten
feet wide and five high, or of greater
dimensions if we choose.</p>

<p>The height of the chimney I believe
to be a matter of no importance
to the draught, and that a low one
will draw as well as a high one. The
worst smoking chimney that I ever
saw was about 47 feet high, in my
own house: it smoked because it was
too small, and was cured by adding
to it the flue of a fire-place directly
above it; on account of which I had to
lose a fire-place on the 2d floor. In this
case the size of both chimneys was
barely sufficient to vent the smoke of
the lower one. The height is a subject
which I have not investigated, but it
strikes me that a low chimney is most
favourable to drawing well: if any one
want an explanation on it, I will give
it again; but it cannot be of much
practical importance. The fashion of
a fire-place is of no importance to
the draught: it may be made to please
the fancy of the builder. I, however,
should prefer one something near
count Rumford's plan. The throat
of the chimney may be contracted or
not at pleasure; but for beauty and
advantage of heat, I should prefer
having the back drawn forward and
the throat narrowed, more especially
in a low fire-place. There may
be local contingent circumstances
connected with chimneys, which
cause them to smoke, and must have
appropriate remedies: but such do
not effect the general principles here
laid down.</p>

<p>Smoke, from fires, is naturally carried
upward by the heated air, which
is specifically lighter than the surrounding
atmosphere, and consequently
ascends, carrying the smoke
with it, and if it meet with no resistance,
will pass up the chimney; but
if that be too small to vent it, it regurgitates,
as it were, into the apartment;
which can only be remedied
on the principle heretofore laid down.</p>

<p>It might be asked, why will not a
small chimney vent all the smoke of
a small fire, in a large fire-place?
Two reasons may be assigned: First,
the heat of such fire cannot produce
a brisk enough current of rarified air
to carry the smoke, and that which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
heated, not having free vent, it whirls
in eddies into the apartment. Secondly,
smoke, in itself, is specifically heavier
than atmospheric air; consisting
of aqueous vapour, carbonic acid, and
oxid of carbon, and coming in contact
with air not much heated, and parting
with a portion of its own heat, it has
then no disposition, in itself, to ascend.
But this would lead to a discussion
foreign to my present subject.</p>
